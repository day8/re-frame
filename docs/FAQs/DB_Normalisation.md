### Question

`app-db` contains a `map`. How do I store normalised data in a `map`, 
bettering mirroring the structure in my server-side database?

### Answer 

These libraries might be interesting to you:
  - [compound](https://github.com/riverford/compound)
  - [SubGraph](https://github.com/vimsical/subgraph)
  - [pull](https://github.com/juxt/pull)
  
If you want to go whole hog and ditch `app-db` and embrace DataScript, 
then you might find [re-posh](https://github.com/denistakeda/re-posh) interesting.
