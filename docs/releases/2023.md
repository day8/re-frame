## Unreleased

> Committed but unreleased changes are put here, at the top. Older releases are detailed chronologically below.

#### Breaking
  - `re-frame.std-interceptors/path` now keeps a `:re-frame.db/path-history` key in the context, not a `:re-frame-path/db-store` key. This shouldn't affect users, unless you're directly hacking the event loop.
  - [763](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/763) on detecting an incorrect event structure, the `unwrap` interceptor now exceptions instead of writing an error to `js/console` and continuing.

#### Added
  - Interceptors now have an optional `:comment` key. It's a no-op.
  - `re-frame.std-interceptors/path` now remembers the path it uses in a `:comment`. ((re-frame-10x#165)[https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x/issues/165])
