## 1.4.4 (2026-01-03)

#### Added

- `:forever` and `:no-cache` Subscription (alpha) lifecycles. See: https://day8.github.io/re-frame/FAQs/alpha/#benefit-more-lifecycles
- Flows (alpha): added tracing. See day8/re-frame-10x v1.11.0 for an implementation of tracing in the "flows" tab.

#### Fixed

- Flows (alpha) now run in response to (non-alpha) re-frame.core events

- Subscription (alpha) signal & calculation functions always receive a map as the query,
  even when invoked with a vector query, or invoked with `re-frame.core/subscribe`.
  This is meant to provide stability, so users can write `reg :sub` handlers wtihout needing to
  think about whether the callsite is alpha, legacy, map or vector.

#### Changed

- Subscriptions (alpha) are more careful to ensure the memory-safety of their input signals. See: https://day8.github.io/re-frame/FAQs/alpha/#benefit-safe-subscriptions

- Changed flows to calculate the new app-db earlier in the chain.
  - Benefit:  user-defined interceptors can access post-flow app-db value.
  - Drawback: they can't access the value of app-db directly resulting from the event handler.
  - Drawback: they can't access flow-related effects like `:reg-flow`.

- Added a :re-frame/pre-flow-db key to the context
  - This way, user-defined interceptors can still access the app-db value resulting directly from the event handler.
