## 1.4.5 (2025-12-11)

#### Added

- `:forever` and `:no-cache` Subscription (alpha) lifecycles. See: https://day8.github.io/re-frame/FAQs/alpha/#benefit-more-lifecycles

#### Fixed

- Flows (alpha) now run in response to (non-alpha) re-frame.core events

#### Changed

- Subscriptions (alpha) are more careful to ensure the memory-safety of their input signals. See: https://day8.github.io/re-frame/FAQs/alpha/#benefit-safe-subscriptions
- Re-frame now passes either a map or a vector to the Subscription (alpha) signal-fn. The value, whether map or vector, is the same as what you pass to `subscribe` or `sub`. See: https://day8.github.io/re-frame/FAQs/alpha/#benefit-map-queries
