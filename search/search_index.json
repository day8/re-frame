It explains what they are, how they can be \"injected\", and how to manage them in tests. What Are They? \u00b6 Event handlers compute how the world should change in response to an event and, to do that, they need to first know the current state of the world. coeffects is the current state of the world, as data, as presented to an event handler. Many event handlers only need application state to do their job - that's as much of \"the world\" as they need to know about. To make this common case easy to program, there's a specific registration function, called reg-event-db , which delivers ONLY the coeffect db to the event handler (and event of course). Such an event handler will have this signature: ( fn [ db event ] ... return updated db ) But event handlers sometimes need to know more about the world OR have more inputs than just application state. Sometimes they need \"inputs\" like a random number, or a GUID, or the current datetime. Perhaps they need access to LocalStore, or Cookies, or a DataScript connection. We refer to these inputs collectively as the event handler's coeffects . When more than application state is needed, we use the registration function reg-event-fx and the event handler has a signature like this: ( fn [ coeffects event ] ;; first arg is often abbreviated to cofx ... return a map of effects ) Notice how previously the first arg was db and now it is coeffects . coeffects is a map, and it contains a :db key which is the current application state. But it can contain other keys holding data about other aspects of the world. So coeffects is a superset of db . It is a bigger world to compute against. A Motivating Example \u00b6 Imagine you had an event handler which needed to \"know\" a value in LocalStore, in order to compute an event's effect. It could be written to access data directly from LocalStore: ( reg-event-db :load-defaults ( fn [ db _ ] ( let [ val ( js->clj ( .getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\" ))] ;; <-- Problem ( assoc db :defaults val )))) This works, but there's a cost. Because it has directly accessed LocalStore, this event handler is not pure, and impure functions cause well-documented paper cuts, and paper cuts have a way of accumulating non-linearly. How We Want It \u00b6 Our goal in this tutorial is to rewrite this event handler so that it only uses data from arguments (coeffects!). This will take a few steps. The first is that we switch to using reg-event-fx (instead of reg-event-db ). Event handlers registered via reg-event-fx are slightly different to those registered via reg-event-db . -fx handlers get two arguments, but the first is not db . Instead it is an argument which we will call cofx (that's a nice distinct name which will aid communication). Previous tutorials showed there's a :db key in cofx . We now want cofx to have other keys and values, like this: ( reg-event-fx ;; note: -fx :load-defaults ( fn [ cofx event ] ;; cofx means coeffects ( let [ val ( :local-store cofx ) ;; <-- get data from cofx db ( :db cofx )] ;; <-- more data from cofx { :db ( assoc db :defaults val )}))) ;; returns an effect Notice how cofx magically contains a :local-store key with the right value. Nice! But how do we make this magic happen? Abracadabra \u00b6 Each time an event is \"handled\", a brand new context (map) is created, and within that context is a :coeffects key which is a further map (initially empty). That pristine context value (containing, in turn, a pristine :coeffects map) is threaded through the :before function of each interceptor (in the event handler chain) before it finally reaches the registered event handler, which sits on the end of the chain, itself wrapped up in an interceptor. We know this story well from a previous tutorial. These :before functions have the opportunity to assoc into the :coeffects map (within the context ), cumulatively adding to what it holds. Later, our event handler, which sits on the end of the chain, finds that its first cofx argument contains just the right data, like, for example, a value for the key :local-store . So, it is the event handler's Interceptor chain which can add to the \"world\" eventually \"seen\" by an event handler. Which Interceptors? \u00b6 If Interceptors put data in :coeffects , then we'll need to add the right ones when we register our event handler. Something like this (this handler is the same as before, except for one detail): ( reg-event-fx :load-defaults [ ( inject-cofx :local-store \"defaults-key\" ) ] ;; <-- this is new ( fn [ cofx event ] ( let [ val ( :local-store cofx ) db ( :db cofx )] { :db ( assoc db :defaults val )}))) Look at that - my event handler now has a new Interceptor which will inject (assoc) the right key/value pair ( :local-store ) into context's :coeffects , which itself is the map which goes on to be the first argument to our event handler (aka cofx ). inject-cofx \u00b6 inject-cofx is part of the re-frame API. It is a function which returns an Interceptor whose :before function loads a key/value pair into a context's :coeffects map. inject-cofx takes either one or two arguments. The first is always the id of the coeffect required (called a cofx-id ). The 2nd is an optional additional value. So, in the case above, the cofx-id was :local-store and the additional value was \"defaults-key\" which was presumably the LocalStore key. More inject-cofx \u00b6 Here's some other usage examples: (inject-cofx :random-int 10) (inject-cofx :guid) (inject-cofx :now) I could create an event handler which has access to 3 coeffects: ( reg-event-fx :some-id [( inject-cofx :random-int 10 ) ( inject-cofx :now ) ( inject-cofx :local-store \"blah\" )] ;; 3 ( fn [ cofx _ ] ... in here I can access cofx 's keys :now :local-store and :random-int )) But that's probably just greedy. And so, to the final piece in the puzzle: how does inject-cofx know what to do when it is given :now or :local-store ? Each cofx-id requires a different action. Meet reg-cofx \u00b6 This function is also part of the re-frame API. It allows you to associate a cofx-id (like :now or :local-store ) with a handler function that injects the right key/value pair. The function you register will be passed two arguments: a :coeffects map (to which it should add a key/value pair), and optionally, the additional value supplied to inject-cofx and it is expected to return a modified :coeffects map. Example Of reg-cofx \u00b6 Above, we wrote an event handler that wanted :now data to be available. Here is how a handler could be registered for :now : ( reg-cofx ;; registration function :now ;; what cofx-id are we registering ( fn [ coeffects _ ] ;; second parameter not used in this case ( assoc coeffects :now ( js.Date. )))) ;; add :now key, with value The outcome is: because that cofx handler above is now registered for :now , I can add an Interceptor to an event handler which looks like (inject-cofx :now) which means within that event handler I can access a :now value from cofx As a result, my event handler is pure. Another Example Of reg-cofx \u00b6 This: ( reg-cofx ;; new registration function :local-store ( fn [ coeffects local-store-key ] ( assoc coeffects :local-store ( js->clj ( .getItem js/localStorage local-store-key ))))) With these two registrations in place, I could now use both (inject-cofx :now) and (inject-cofx :local-store \"blah\") in an event handler's interceptor chain. To put this another way: I can't use (inject-cofx :blah) UNLESS I have previously used reg-cofx to register a handler for :blah . Otherwise inject-cofx doesn't know how to inject a :blah . Secret Interceptors \u00b6 In a previous tutorial we learned that reg-events-db and reg-events-fx add default interceptors to the front of the interceptor chain specified during registration. We found they inserted an Interceptor called do-fx . I can now reveal that they also add (inject-cofx :db) at the front of each chain. Guess what that injects into the :coeffects of every event handler? This is how :db is always available to event handlers. Okay, so that was the last surprise. Now you know everything. If ever you wanted to use DataScript, instead of an atom-containing-a-map like app-db , you'd replace reg-event-db and reg-event-fx with your own registration functions and have them auto insert the DataScript connection. Testing \u00b6 During testing, you may want to stub out certain coeffects. You may, for example, want to test that an event handler works using a specific now . In your test, you'd mock out the cofx handler: ( reg-cofx :now ( fn [ coeffects _ ] ( assoc coeffects :now ( js/Date. 2016 1 1 ))) ;; then is `:now` If your test does alter registered coeffect handlers, and you are using cljs.test , then you can use a fixture to restore all coeffects at the end of your test: ( defn fixture-re-frame [] ( let [ restore-re-frame ( atom nil )] { :before # ( reset! restore-re-frame ( re-frame.core/make-restore-fn )) :after # ( @ restore-re-frame )})) ( use-fixtures :each ( fixture-re-frame )) re-frame.core/make-restore-fn creates a checkpoint for re-frame state (including registered handlers) to which you can return. The 5 Point Summary \u00b6 In note form: Event handlers should only source data from their arguments We want to \"inject\" required data into the first, cofx argument We use the (inject-cofx :key) interceptor in registration of the event handler It will look up the registered cofx handler for that :key to do the injection We must have previously registered a cofx handler via reg-cofx","title":"Coeffects"},{"location":"Coeffects/#coeffects","text":"This tutorial explains coeffects .

It writes to console.log : the event being processed, for example: [:attempt-world-record true] the changes made to db by the handler in processing the event debug uses clojure.data/diff to compare the value of app-db before and after the handler ran, showing what changed. clojure.data/diff returns a triple , the first two entries of which debug will display in console.log (the 3rd says what has not changed and isn't interesting). The output produced by clojure.data/diff can take some getting used to, but you should stick with it -- your effort will be rewarded. Using debug \u00b6 So, you will add this Interceptor like this: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :some-id [ re-frame.core/debug ] ;; <---- added here! some-handler-fn ) Except, of course, we need to be more deft - we only want debug in development builds. We don't want the overhead of those clojure.data/diff calculations in production. So, this is better: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :some-id [( when ^ boolean goog.DEBUG re-frame.core/debug )] ;; <---- conditional! some-handler-fn ) goog.DEBUG is a compile time constant provided by the Google Closure Compiler . It will be true when the build within project.clj is :optimization :none and false otherwise. Ha! I see a problem, you say. In production, that when is going to leave a nil in the interceptor vector. So the Interceptor vector will be [nil] . Surely that's a problem? Well, actually, no it isn't. re-frame filters out any nil from interceptor vectors. Too Much Repetition - Part 1 \u00b6 Each event handler has its own interceptor stack. That might be all very flexible, but does that mean we have to put this debug business on every single handler? That would be very repetitive. Yes, you will have to put it on each handler. And, yes, that could be repetitive, unless you take some steps. One thing you can do is to define standard interceptors at the top of the event.cljs namespace: ( def standard-interceptors [( when ^ boolean goog.DEBUG debug ) another-interceptor ]) And then, for any one event handler, the code would look like: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :some-id standard-interceptors ;; <--- use the common definition some-handler-fn ) or perhaps: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :some-id [ standard-interceptors specific-interceptor ] ;; mix with something specific some-handler-fn ) So that specific-interceptor could be something required for just this one event handler, and it can be combined with the standard ones. Wait on! \"I see a problem\", you say. standard-interceptors is a vector , and it is within another vector along side specific-interceptor - so that's nested vectors of interceptors! No problem, re-frame uses flatten to take out all the nesting - the result is a simple chain of interceptors. And, as we have discussed, nil s are removed. 3. Checking DB Integrity \u00b6 Always have a detailed schema for the data in app-db ! Why? First , schemas serve as invaluable documentation. When I come to a new app, the first thing I want to look at is the underlying information model - the schema of the data. I hope it is well commented and I expect it to be rigorous and complete, using Clojure spec or, perhaps, a Prismatic Schema . Second a good spec allows you to assert the integrity and correctness of the data in app-db . Because all the data is in one place, that means you are asserting the integrity of ALL the data in your app, at one time. All of it. When should we do this? Ideally, every time a change is made! Well, it turns out that only event handlers can change the value in app-db , so only an event handler could corrupt it. So, we'd like to recheck the integrity of app-db immediately after every event handler has run . All of it, every time. This allows us to catch any errors very early, easily assigning blame (to the rogue event handler). Schemas are typically put into db.cljs (see the todomvc example in the re-frame repo). Here's an example using Prismatic Schema (although a more modern choice would be to use Clojure spec ): ( ns my.namespace.db ( :require [ schema.core :as s ])) ;; As exactly as possible, describe the correct shape of app-db ;; Add a lot of helpful comments. This will be an important resource ;; for someone looking at your code for the first time. ( def schema { :a { :b s/Str :c s/Int } :d [{ :e s/Keyword :f [ s/Num ]}]}) And a function which will check a db value against that schema: ( defn valid-schema? \"validate the given db, writing any problems to console.error\" [ db ] ( let [ res ( s/check schema db )] ( if ( some? res ) ( .error js/console ( str \"schema problem: \" res ))))) Now, let's organise for valid-schema? to be run after every handler. We'll use the built-in after Interceptor factory function: ( def standard-interceptors [( when ^ boolean goog.DEBUG debug ) ( when ^ boolean goog.DEBUG ( after db/valid-schema? ))]) ;; <-- new Now, the instant a handler messes up the structure of app-db you'll be alerted. But this overhead won't be there in production. Too Much Repetition - Part 2 \u00b6 Above, we discussed a way of \"factoring out\" common interceptors into standard-interceptors . There's an additional technique we can use to ensure that all event handlers get certain Interceptors: you write a custom registration function -- a replacement for reg-event-db -- like this: ( defn my-reg-event-db ;; alternative to reg-event-db ([ id handler-fn ] ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db id standard-interceptors handler-fn )) ([ id interceptors handler-fn ] ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db id [ standard-interceptors interceptors ] handler-fn ))) Notice how this registration function inserts our standard interceptors every time. From now on, you can register your event handlers like this and know that the two standard Interceptors have been inserted: ( my-reg-event-db ;; <-- adds std interceptors automatically :some-id some-handler-fn ) What about the -fx variation? \u00b6 Above we created my-reg-event-db as a new registration function for -db handlers. Now, -db handlers take db and event arguments, and return a new db . So, they MUST return a new db value. But what if we tried to do the same for -fx handlers which, instead, return an effects map which may, or may not, contain a :db ? Our solution would have to allow for the absence of a new db value (by doing no validity check, because nothing was being changed).

Yes, a surprising claim. Events Happen \u00b6 Events \"happen\" when they are dispatched. So, this makes an event happen: ( dispatch [ :repair-ming-vase true ]) Events are normally triggered by an external agent: the user clicks a button, or a server-pushed message arrives on a websocket. Handling The Happening \u00b6 Once dispatched, an event must be \"handled\" - which means it must be processed or actioned. Events are mutative by nature. If your application is in one state before an event is processed, it will be in a different state afterwards. And that state change is very desirable. Without the state change our application can't incorporate that button click, or the newly arrived websocket message. Without mutation, an app would just sit there, stuck. State change is how an application \"moves forward\" - how it does its job. Useful! On the other hand, control logic and state mutation tend to be the most complex and error prone part of an app. Your Handling \u00b6 To help wrangle this potential complexity, re-frame's introduction provided you with a simple programming model. It said you should call reg-event-db to associate an event id, with a function to do the handling: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db ;; <-- call this to register a handler :set-flag ;; this is an event id ( fn [ db [ _ new-value ]] ;; this function does the handling ( assoc db :flag new-value ))) The function you register, handles events with a given id . And that handler fn is expected to be pure. Given the value in app-db as the first argument, and the event (vector) as the second argument, it is expected to provide a new value for app-db . Data in, a computation and data out. Pure. 90% Solution \u00b6 This paradigm provides a lovely solution 90% of the time, but there are times when it isn't enough. Here's an example from the messy 10%. To get its job done, this handler has to side effect: ( reg-event-db :my-event ( fn [ db [ _ bool ]] ( dispatch [ :do-something-else 3 ]) ;; oops, side-effect ( assoc db :send-spam new-val ))) That dispatch queues up another event to be processed. It changes the world. Just to be clear, this code works. The handler returns a new version of db , so tick, and that dispatch will itself be \"handled\" asynchronously very shortly after this handler finishes, double tick. So, you can \"get away with it\". But it ain't pure. And here's more carnage: ( reg-event-db :my-event ( fn [ db [ _ a ]] ( GET \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\" ;; dirty great big side-effect { :handler # ( dispatch [ :process-response %1 ]) :error-handler # ( dispatch [ :bad-response %1 ])}) ( assoc db :flag true ))) Again, this approach will work. But that dirty great big side-effect doesn't come for free. It's like a muddy monster truck has shown up in our field of white tulips. Bad, Why? \u00b6 The moment we stop writing pure functions there are well documented consequences: Cognitive load for the function's later readers goes up because they can no longer reason locally. Testing becomes more difficult and involves \"mocking\". How do we test that the http GET above is using the right URL? \"mocking\" should be mocked. It is a bad omen. And event replay-ability is lost. Regarding the 3rd point above, a re-frame application proceeds step by step, like a reduce. From the README: at any one time, the value in app-db is the result of performing a reduce over the entire collection of events dispatched in the app up until that time. The combining function for this reduce is the set of registered event handlers. Such a collection of events is replay-able which is a dream for debugging and testing. But only when all the handlers are pure. Handlers with side-effects (like that HTTP GET, or the dispatch ) pollute the replay, inserting extra events into it, etc., which ruins the process. The 2nd Kind Of Problem \u00b6 And there's the other kind of purity problem: ( reg-event-db :load-localstore ( fn [ db _ ] ( let [ val ( js->clj ( .getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\" ))] ;; <-- Problem ( assoc db :defaults val )))) You'll notice the event handler obtains data from LocalStore. Although this handler has no side effect - it doesn't need to change the world - that action of obtaining data from somewhere other than its arguments, means it isn't pure. Effects And Coeffects \u00b6 When striving for pure event handlers there are two considerations : Effects - what your event handler does to the world (aka side-effects) Coeffects - the data your event handler requires from the world in order to do its computation (aka side-causes ) We'll need a solution for both. Why Does This Happen? \u00b6 It is inevitable that, say, 10% of your event handlers have effects and coeffects. They have to implement the control logic of your re-frame app, which means dealing with the outside, mutative world of servers, databases, window.location, LocalStore, cookies, etc. There's just no getting away from living in a mutative world, which sounds pretty ominous. Is that it? Are we doomed to impurity? Well, luckily a small twist in the tale makes a profound difference. We will look at side-effects first. Instead of creating event handlers which do side-effects , we'll instead get them to cause side-effects . Doing vs Causing \u00b6 I proudly claim that this event handler is pure: ( reg-event-db :my-event ( fn [ db _ ] ( assoc db :flag true ))) Takes a db value, computes and returns a db value. No coeffects or effects. Yep, that's Pure! Yes, all true, but ... this purity is only possible because re-frame is doing the necessary side-effecting. Wait on. What \"necessary side-effecting\"? Well, application state is stored in app-db , right? And it is a ratom. And after each event handler runs, it must be reset! to the newly returned value. Notice reset! . That, right there, is the \"necessary side effecting\". We get to live in our ascetic functional world because re-frame is looking after the \"necessary side-effects\" on app-db . Et tu, React? \u00b6 Turns out it's the same pattern with Reagent/React. We get to write a nice pure component, like: ( defn say-hi [ name ] [ :div \"Hello \" name ]) and Reagent/React mutates the DOM for us. The framework is looking after the \"necessary side-effects\". Pattern Structure \u00b6 Pause and look back at say-hi . I'd like you to view it through the following lens: it is a pure function which returns a description of the side-effects required . It says: add a div element to the DOM. Notice that the description is declarative. We don't tell React how to do it. Notice also that it is data. Hiccup is just vectors and maps. This is a big, important concept. While we can't get away from certain side-effects, we can program using pure functions which describe side-effects, declaratively, in data and let the backing framework look after the \"doing\" of them. Efficiently. Discreetly. Let's use this pattern to solve the side-effecting event-handler problem. Effects: The Two Step Plan \u00b6 From here, two steps: Work out how event handlers can declaratively describe side-effects, in data. Work out how re-frame can do the \"necessary side-effecting\". Efficiently and discreetly. Step 1 Of Plan \u00b6 So, how would it look if event handlers returned side-effects, declaratively, in data? Here is an impure, side effecting handler: ( reg-event-db :my-event ( fn [ db [ _ a ]] ( dispatch [ :do-something-else 3 ]) ;; <-- Eeek, side-effect ( assoc db :flag true ))) Here it is re-written so as to be pure: ( reg-event-fx ;; <1> :my-event ( fn [{ :keys [ db ]} [ _ a ]] ;; <2> { :db ( assoc db :flag true ) ;; <3> :dispatch [ :do-something-else 3 ]})) Notes: <1> we're using reg-event-fx instead of reg-event-db to register (that's -db vs -fx ) <2> the first parameter is no longer just db . It is a map from which we are destructuring db , i.e. it is a map which contains a :db key. <3> The handler is returning a data structure (map) which describes two side-effects: a change to application state, via the :db key a further event, via the :dispatch key Above, the impure handler did a dispatch side-effect, while the pure handler described a dispatch side-effect. Another Example \u00b6 The impure way: ( reg-event-db :my-event ( fn [ db [ _ a ]] ( GET \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\" ;; dirty great big side-effect { :handler # ( dispatch [ :process-response %1 ]) :error-handler # ( dispatch [ :bad-response %1 ])}) ( assoc db :flag true ))) the pure, descriptive alternative: ( reg-event-fx :my-event ( fn [{ :keys [ db ]} [ _ a ]] { :http { :method :get :url \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\" :on-success [ :process-blah-response ] :on-fail [ :failed-blah ]} :db ( assoc db :flag true )})) Again, the old way did a side-effect (Booo!) and the new way describes , declaratively, in data, the side-effects required (Yaaa!). More on side effects in a minute, but let's double back to coeffects. The Coeffects \u00b6 So far we've written our new style -fx handlers like this: ( reg-event-fx :my-event ( fn [{ :keys [ db ]} event ] ;; <-- destructuring to get db { ... })) It is now time to name that first argument: ( reg-event-fx :my-event ( fn [ cofx event ] ;; <--- thy name be cofx { ... })) When you use the -fx form of registration, the first argument of your handler will be a map of coeffects which we name cofx . In that map will be the complete set of \"inputs\" required by your function. The complete set of computational resources (data) needed to perform its computation. But how? This will be explained in an upcoming tutorial, I promise, but for the moment, take it as a magical given. One of the keys in cofx will likely be :db and that will be the value of app-db . Remember this impure handler from before: ( reg-event-db ;; a -db registration :load-localstore ( fn [ db _ ] ;; db first argument ( let [ defaults ( js->clj ( .getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\" ))] ;; <-- Eeek!! ( assoc db :defaults defaults )))) It was impure because it obtained an input from other than its arguments. We'd now rewrite it as a pure handler, like this: ( reg-event-fx ;; notice the -fx :load-localstore ( fn [ cofx _ ] ;; cofx is a map containing inputs ( let [ defaults ( :local-store cofx )] ;; <-- use it here { :db ( assoc ( :db cofx ) :defaults defaults )}))) ;; returns effects map So, by some magic, not yet revealed, LocalStore will be queried before this handler runs and the required value from it will be placed into cofx under the key :local-store for the handler to use. That process leaves the handler itself pure because it only sources data from arguments. Variations On A Theme \u00b6 -db handlers and -fx handlers are conceptually the same. They only differ numerically. -db handlers take one coeffect called db , and they return only one effect (db again). Whereas -fx handlers take potentially many coeffects (a map of them) and they return potentially many effects (a map of them). So, One vs Many. Just to be clear, the following two handlers achieve the same thing: ( reg-event-db :set-flag ( fn [ db [ _ new-value ]] ( assoc db :flag new-value ))) vs ( reg-event-fx :set-flag ( fn [ cofx [ _ new-value ]] { :db ( assoc ( :db cofx ) :flag new-value )})) Obviously the -db variation is simpler and you'd use it whenever you can. The -fx version is more flexible, so it will sometimes have its place. Summary \u00b6 90% of the time, simple -db handlers are the right tool to use. But about 10% of the time, our handlers need additional inputs (coeffects) or they need to cause additional side-effects (effects). That's when you reach for -fx handlers. -fx handlers allow us to return effects, declaratively in data. In the next tutorial, we'll shine a light on interceptors which are the mechanism by which event handlers are executed. That knowledge will give us a springboard to then, as a next step, better understand coeffects and effects. We'll soon be writing our own.","title":"Effectful Handlers"},{"location":"EffectfulHandlers/#events-happen","text":"Events \"happen\" when they are dispatched.

In that map will be the complete set of \"inputs\" required by your function. The complete set of computational resources (data) needed to perform its computation. But how? This will be explained in an upcoming tutorial, I promise, but for the moment, take it as a magical given. One of the keys in cofx will likely be :db and that will be the value of app-db . Remember this impure handler from before: ( reg-event-db ;; a -db registration :load-localstore ( fn [ db _ ] ;; db first argument ( let [ defaults ( js->clj ( .getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\" ))] ;; <-- Eeek!! ( assoc db :defaults defaults )))) It was impure because it obtained an input from other than its arguments.

We'll soon be writing our own.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"Effects/","text":"Maybe 20% of the time, event handlers need to cause side effects. This tutorial explains how side effects are actioned, how you can create your own side effects, and how you can make side effects a noop in testing and event replays. Where Effects Come From \u00b6 When an event handler is registered via reg-event-fx , it must return effects. Like this: ( reg-event-fx ;; -fx registration, not -db registration :my-event ( fn [ cofx [ _ a ]] ;; 1st argument is coeffects, instead of db { :db ( assoc ( :db cofx ) :flag a ) :dispatch [ :do-something-else 3 ]})) ;; return effects -fx handlers return a description of the side-effects required, and that description is a map. The Effects Map \u00b6 An effects map contains instructions. Each key/value pair in the map is one instruction - the key uniquely identifies the particular side effect required, and the value for that key provides further data. The type of value depends on the specific side-effect. Here's the two instructions from the example above: { :db ( assoc db :flag a ) ;; side effect on app-db :dispatch [ :do-something-else 3 ]} ;; dispatch this event The :db key instructs that \"app-db\" should be reset! to the value supplied. And the :dispatch key instructs that an event should be dispatched. The value is the vector to dispatch. There are many other possible effects, like for example :dispatch-later , dispatch-n , :set-local-store , etc. And so on. And so on. Which brings us to a problem. Infinite Effects \u00b6 Although re-frame supplies a number of built-in effect handlers, the set of possible effects is open ended. What if you use PostgreSQL and want an effect which issues mutating queries? Or what if you want to send logs to Logentries or metrics to DataDog. Or write values to windows.location . Or save cookies. The list of effects is long and varied, with everyone needing to use a different combination. So effect handling has to be extensible. You need a way to define your own side effects. Extensible Side Effects \u00b6 re-frame provides a function reg-fx through which you can register your own Effect Handlers . Use it like this: ( reg-fx ;; <-- registration function :butterfly ;; <1> ( fn [ value ] ;; <2> ... )) <1> the key for the effect. When later an effects map contains the key :butterfly , the function we are registering will be used to action it. <2> the function which actions the side effect. Later, it will be called with one argument - the value in the effects map, for this key. So, if an event handler returned these two effects: { :dispatch [ :save-maiden 42 ] :butterfly \"Flapping\" } ;; butterfly effect, but no chaos !! Then the function we registered for :butterfly would be called to handle that effect. And it would be called with the parameter \"Flapping\". So, terminology: :butterfly is an \"effect key\" and the function registered is an \"effect handler\". So re-frame has both event handlers and effect handlers and they are different, despite them both starting with e and ending in t !! Writing An Effect Handler \u00b6 A word of advice - make them as simple as possible, and then simplify them further. You don't want them containing any fancy logic. Why? Well, because they are all side-effecty they will be a pain to test rigorously. And the combination of fancy logic and limited testing always ends in tears. If not now, later. A second word of advice - when you create an effect handler, you also have to design (and document!) the structure of the value expected. When you do, realise that you are designing a nano DSL for value and try to make that design simple too. If you resist being terse and smart, and instead, favor slightly verbose and obvious, your future self will thank you. Create as little cognitive overhead as possible for the eventual readers of your effectful code. Right. So, this advice coming from the guy who named effects fx ... Oh, the hypocrisy. In my defence, here's the built-in effect handler for :db : ( reg-fx :db ( fn [ value ] ( reset! re-frame.db/app-db value ))) So, yeah, simple ... and, because of it, I can almost guarantee there's no bug in ... bang, crash, smoke, flames. Note The return value of an effect handler is ignored. :db Not Always Needed \u00b6 An effects map does not need to include the effect key :db . It is perfectly valid for an event handler to not change app-db . In fact, it is perfectly valid for an event handler to return an effects map of {} . Slightly puzzling, but not a problem. What Makes This Work? \u00b6 A silently inserted interceptor. Whenever you register an event handler via either reg-event-db or reg-event-fx , an interceptor, cunningly named do-fx , is inserted at the beginning of the chain. Example: if your event handler registration looked like this: ( reg-event-fx :some-id [ debug ( path :right )] ;; <-- two interceptors, apparently ( fn [ cofx _ ] {}) ;; <-- imagine returned effects here While it might look like you have registered with 2 interceptors, reg-event-fx will make it 3: [ do-fx debug ( path :right )] It silently inserts do-fx at the front, and this is a good thing. The placement of do-fx at the beginning of the interceptor chain means its :after function would be the final act when the chain is executed (forwards and then backwards, as described in the Interceptor Tutorial). In this final act, the :after function extracts :effects from context and simply iterates across the key/value pairs it contains, calling the registered \"effect handlers\" for each. For the record The FISA Court requires that we deny all claims that do-fx is secretly injected NSA surveillance-ware. We also note that you've been sloppy with your personal grooming again, including, but not limited to, forgetting to clean your teeth on one occassion last week. If ever you want to take control of the way effect handling is done, create your own alternative to reg-event-fx and, in it, inject your own version of the do-fx interceptor at the front of the interceptor chain. It is only a few lines of code. Order Of Effects? \u00b6 There isn't one. do-fx does not currently provide you with control over the order in which side effects occur. The :db side effect might happen before :dispatch , or not. You can't rely on it. Is That A Problem? If you feel you need ordering, then please open an issue and explain the usecase. The current absence of good usecases is the reason ordering isn't implemented. So give us a usercase and we'll revisit, maybe. For The Record If, later, ordering was needed, it might be handled via metadata on :effects . Also, perhaps by allowing reg-fx to optionally take two functions: an effects pre-process fn <-- new. Takes :effects returns :effects the effects handler (as already described above). Anyway, these are all just possibilities. But not needed or implemented yet. Effects With No Data \u00b6 Some effects have no associated data: ( reg-event-fx :some-id ( fn [ coeffect _ ] { :exit-fullscreen nil })) ;; <--- no data, use a nil In these cases, although it looks odd, just supply nil as the value for this key. The associated effect handler would look like: ( reg-fx :exit-fullscreen ( fn [ _ ] ;; we don't bother with that nil value ( .exitFullscreen js/document ))) Testing And Noops \u00b6 When you are running tests or replaying events, it is sometimes useful to stub out effects. This is easily done - you simply register a noop effect handler. Want to stub out the :dispatch effect? Do this: ( reg-fx :dispatch ( fn [ _ ] )) ;; a noop If your test does alter registered effect handlers, and you are using cljs.test , then you can use a fixture to restore all effect handlers at the end of your test: ( defn fixture-re-frame [] ( let [ restore-re-frame ( atom nil )] { :before # ( reset! restore-re-frame ( re-frame.core/make-restore-fn )) :after # ( @ restore-re-frame )})) ( use-fixtures :each ( fixture-re-frame )) re-frame.core/make-restore-fn creates a checkpoint for re-frame state (including registered handlers) to which you can return. Existing Effect Handlers \u00b6 re-frame's built-in effect handlers, like dispatch-n and dispatch-later , are detailed in the API document. And please review the External-Resources document for a list of 3rd party Effect Handlers. Summary \u00b6 The 4 Point Summary in note form: Event handlers should only return a description of required effects They return a map like {:effect1 value1 :effect2 value2} Keys of this map can refer to builtin effect handlers (see below) or custom ones We use reg-fx to register our own effect handlers, built-in ones are already registered","title":"Effects"},{"location":"Effects/#where-effects-come-from","text":"When an event handler is registered via reg-event-fx , it must return effects.

Until now, they have been a hidden detail but, as we are about to find out, they are both important and useful. Why Interceptors? \u00b6 There's two reasons. First , we want simple event handlers. Interceptors allow us nicely to look after \"cross-cutting\" concerns like undo, tracing and validation. They help us to factor out commonality, hide complexity and introduce further steps into the \"Derived Data, Flowing\" story promoted by re-frame. So, you'll want to use Interceptors because they solve problems, and help you to write nice code. Second , under the covers, Interceptors provide the mechanism underneath Dominos 2 and 3. They are a central concept and understanding them better will serve you well, even if you don't need to directly use them very often. What Do Interceptors Do? \u00b6 They wrap. Specifically, they wrap event handlers. Imagine your event handler is like a piece of ham. An interceptor would be like bread on either side of your ham, which makes a sandwich. And two Interceptors, in a chain, would be like you put another pair of bread slices around the outside of the existing sandwich to make a sandwich of the sandwich. Now it is a very thick sandwich. Interceptors wrap on both sides of an event handler, layer after layer. Wait, I know That Pattern! \u00b6 Interceptors implement middleware , but differently. Traditional middleware - often seen in web servers - creates a data processing pipeline (to process arriving HTTP requests) via the nested composition of higher order functions. The result is a \"stack\" of functions. Data representing a request flows through this pipeline, first forwards from one end to the other, and then backwards (as the response). Interceptors achieve the same outcome by assembling functions, as data, in a collection - a chain of interceptors, rather than a stack of middleware. Data can then be iteratively pipelined, first forwards through the functions in the chain, and then backwards along the same chain. Because the interceptor pipeline is composed via a collection (data!), rather than higher order functions, it is a more flexible arrangement. What's In The Pipeline? \u00b6 Data. It flows through the pipeline being progressively transformed. Fine. But what data? With a web server, the middleware \"stack\" progressively transforms an HTTP request in one direction, and, then in the backwards sweep, it progressively produces a response . In re-frame, the forward sweep progressively creates coeffects (inputs to the event handler that you write), while the backwards sweep processes the effects (outputs from the event handler you write). I'll pause while you read that sentence again. That's the key concept, right there. Show Me \u00b6 At the time when you register an event handler, you can provide a chain of interceptors too. Using a 3-arity registration function: ( reg-event-db :some-id [ in1 in2 ] ;; <-- a chain of 2 interceptors (a vector of 2 interceptors) ( fn [ db v ] ;; <-- the handler here, as before .... ))) Each Event Handler can have its own tailored interceptor chain, provided at registration-time. Handlers Are Interceptors Too \u00b6 You could see that registration above as associating :some-id with two things: a chain of 2 interceptors [in1 in2] an event handler . Except, the event handler is turned into an interceptor too (we'll see how shortly). So, actually , :some-id is only associated with one thing: a 3-chain of interceptors, with the event handler wrapped in an interceptor, called say ih , and put on the end of the other two, forming a vector of three interceptors: [in1 in2 ih] . But wait, there's more. The registration function itself, reg-event-db , actually takes this 3-chain and inserts its own standard interceptors, called say std1 and std2 (which do useful things, again more soon) at the front, so ACTUALLY , there's about 5 interceptors in the chain: [std1 std2 in1 in2 ih] So, ultimately, that event registration associates the event id :some-id with just a chain of interceptors. Nothing more. Later, when a (dispatch [:some-id ...]) happens, that 5-chain of interceptors will be \"executed\". And that's how an event gets handled. The Links Of The Chain \u00b6 Each interceptor has this form: { :id :something ;; decorative only - can be ignored :before ( fn [ context ] ... ) ;; returns a possibly modified `context` :after ( fn [ context ] ... )} ;; returns a possibly modified `context` That's essentially a map of two functions. Now imagine a vector of these maps - that's an interceptor chain. Above we imagined an interceptor chain of [std1 std2 in1 in2 ih] . Now we know that this is really a vector of 5 maps: [{...} {...} {...} {...} {...}] where each of the 5 maps have a :before and :after fn. Sometimes, the :before and :after functions are noops - they take a context and return that context unchanged - think identity . To \"execute\" an interceptor chain: create a context (which is a map with a certain structure, described below) iterate forwards over the chain, calling the :before function on each interceptor, threading context through each call. iterate over the chain in the opposite (backwards) direction calling the :after function on each interceptor and threading context through all the calls Remember that the last interceptor in the chain is the event handler itself (wrapped up to be the :before ). That's it. That's how an event gets handled. This is how Dominoes 2 and 3 happen. What Is Context? \u00b6 Some data called a context is threaded through all the calls. This value is passed as the argument to every :before and :after function and it is returned by each function, possibly modified. A context is a map with this structure: { :coeffects { :event [ :some-id :some-param ] :db <original contents of app-db> } :effects { :db <new value for app-db> :dispatch [ :an-event-id :param1 ]} :queue <a collection of further interceptors> :stack <a collection of interceptors already walked> } context has a :coeffects key and an :effects key which, if this was a web server, would be somewhat analogous to request and response respectively. :coeffects will contain the inputs required by the event handler (sitting presumably on the end of the chain). So that's data like the :event being processed, and the initial state of db . The handler-returned side effects are put into :effects including, but not limited to, a new value for app-db . The first few interceptors in a chain (the ones inserted by reg-event-db ) have :before functions which prime the :coeffects by adding in :event , and :db . Of course, other interceptors can add further to :coeffects . Perhaps the event handler needs data from localstore, or a random number, or a DataScript connection. Interceptors can accumulate interesting information into :coeffects , via their :before function. Equally, some interceptors in the chain will have an :after function which processes the side effects accumulated into :effects including, but not limited to, updates to app-db . Threading the Context \u00b6 Above, we imagined an interceptor chain like: [std1 std2 in1 in2 ih] . One way to imagine the whole event handling process would be to see it written like this: ;; start by creating a context map ( let [ context { :coeffects {} :effects {} ... }] ( -> context ;; Thread `context` through all the `:before` functions. ;; This phase is usually concerned with building up `:coeffects` (( :before std1 ) ) ;; noop (( :before std2 ) ) ;; adds `:event` and `:db` to `:coeffects` (( :before in1 ) ) (( :before in2 ) ) (( :before ih ) ) ;; Domino 2 - handler called & return value put into `:effects` ;; Now backwards through the `:after` functions ;; This phase is usually concerned with building up or processing `:effects` ;; But could involve side effects like logging, or undo/redo state actions, etc (( :after ih ) ) ;; noop (( :after in2 ) ) (( :after in1 ) ) (( :after std2 ) ) ;; noop (( :after std1 ) ) ;; Domino 3 - all the `:effects` are processed Infographics \u00b6 Self Modifying \u00b6 There's something not shown in the above schematic. Through both stages (the :before sweep and the :after sweep), context also contains a :queue key which is the queue interceptors yet to be processed, and a :stack key which is vector of of the interceptors already done. In advanced cases, these two values, within a context , can be modified by the :before and :after functions through which the context is threaded. So interceptors can be dynamically added and removed from :queue and :stack by Interceptors already in the chain. Credit \u00b6 All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered -- Galileo Galilei This elegant and flexible arrangement was originally designed by the Pedestal Team . Thanks! Let's Write An Interceptor \u00b6 Dunno about you, but I'm easily offended by underscores. Imagine we had a view which did this: ( dispatch [ :delete-item 42 ]) We'd have to write this event handler: ( reg-event-db :delete-item ( fn [ db [ _ key-to-delete ]] ;; <---- Arrgggghhh underscore ( dissoc db key-to-delete ))) Do you see it there? That _ in the event destructuring!!! Almost mocking us with that passive aggressive, understated thing it has going on!! Co-workers have said I'm \"being overly sensitive\", perhaps even pixel-ist, but you can see it too, right? Of course you can. What a relief it would be to not have it there, but how? We'll write an interceptor: trim-event Once we have written trim-event , our registration will change to look like this: ( reg-event-db :delete-item [ trim-event ] ;; <--- interceptor added ( fn [ db [ key-to-delete ]] ;; <---yaaah! no leading underscore ( dissoc db key-to-delete ))) trim-event will need to change the :coeffects map (within context ). Specifically, it will be changing the :event value within the :coeffects . :event will start off as [:delete-item 42] , but will end up [42] by the time it is supplied to the handler. trim-event will remove that leading :delete-item because, by the time the event is being processed, we already know what id it has. And, so here it is: ( def trim-event ( re-frame.core/->interceptor :id :trim-event :before ( fn [ context ] ( let [ trim-fn ( fn [ event ] ( -> event rest vec ))] ( update-in context [ :coeffects :event ] trim-fn ))))) As you read this, look back to what a context looks like. Notes: We use the API function ->interceptor to create an interceptor (which is just a map) Our interceptor only has a :before function Our :before is given context . It modifies it and returns it. There is no :after for this Interceptor. It has nothing to do with the backwards processing flow of :effects . It is concerned only with :coeffects in the forward flow. Wrapping Handlers \u00b6 We're going well. Let's do an advanced wrapping. Earlier, in the \"Handlers Are Interceptors Too\" section, I explained that event handlers are wrapped in an Interceptor and placed on the end of an Interceptor chain. Remember the whole [std1 std2 in1 in2 ih] thing? We'll now look at the ih bit. How does an event handler get wrapped to be an Interceptor? Reminder - there's two kinds of event handler: the -db variety registered by reg-event-db the -fx variety registered by reg-event-fx I'll now show how to wrap the -db variety. Reminder: here's what a -db handler looks like: ( fn [ db event ] ;; takes two params ( assoc db :flag true )) ;; returns a new db So, we'll be writing a function which takes a -db handler as an argument, and returns an Interceptor which wraps that handler: ( defn db-handler->interceptor [ db-handler-fn ] ( re-frame.core/->interceptor ;; an API function supplied by re-frame :id :db-handler ;; ids are decorative only :before ( fn [ context ] ;; this interceptor only has a `:before ( let [{ :keys [ db event ]} ( :coeffects context ) ;; extract db and event from coeffects new-db ( db-handler-fn db event )] ;; call the event handler ( assoc-in context [ :effects :db ] new-db )))))) ;; put db back into :effects, as `:db` effect Notes: Notice how this wrapper extracts data from the context's :coeffects and then calls the handler with that data (a handler must be called with two args: db and event ) Equally notice how this wrapping takes the return value from db-handler-fn handler and puts it into context's :effects The modified context (it has a new :effects ) is returned This is all done in :before . There is no :after (it is a noop). But this could have been reversed with the work happening in :after and :before a noop. Shrug. Remember that this Interceptor will be on the end of a chain. Feeling confident? Try writing the wrapper for -fx handlers - it is just a small variation. Summary \u00b6 In this tutorial, we've learned: 1. When you register an event handler, you can supply a collection of Interceptors : ( reg-event-db :some-id [ in1 in2 ] ;; <-- a chain of 2 interceptors ( fn [ db v ] ;; <-- real handler here .... ))) 2. When you are registering an event handler, you are associating an event id with a chain of interceptors including: the ones you supply (optional) in1 and in2 an extra one on the end, which wraps the event handler itself (we called it ih ) a couple at the beginning of the chain std1 & std2 , put there by the reg-event-db or reg-event-fx . the entire interceptor chain might end up a vector of 5 - [std1 std2 in1 in2 ih] 3. An Interceptor Chain is executed in two stages. First a forwards sweep in which all :before functions are called, and then second, a backwards sweep in which the :after functions are called. A context map will be threaded through all these calls. An Interceptor chain is a reified \"call stack\". 4. Interceptors do interesting things to context : add to :coeffects (data inputs to the handler) process side :effects (returned by a handler) produce logs further process In the next Tutorial, we'll look at (side) Effects in more depth. Later again, we'll look at Coeffects. Appendix - Built-in Interceptors \u00b6 re-frame comes with some built-in Interceptors: debug : log each event as it is processed. Shows incremental clojure.data/diff reports. trim-v : a convenience. More readable handlers. And some Interceptor factories (functions that return Interceptors): enrich : perform additional computations (validations?), after the handler has run. More derived data flowing. after : perform side effects, after a handler has run. Eg: use it to report if the data in app-db matches a schema. path : a convenience. Simplifies our handlers. Acts almost like update-in . In addition, a Library like re-frame-undo provides an Interceptor factory called undoable which checkpoints app state.

Register Handlers \u00b6 re-frame's various handlers all work in the same way. You declare and register your handlers in the one step, like this \"event handler\" example: ( re-frame/reg-event-db ;; event handler will be registered automatically :some-id ( fn [ db [ _ value ]] ... do some state change based on db and value )) As a result, there's nothing further you need to do because handler registration happens as a direct result of loading the code (presumably via a <script> tag in your HTML file). 2. Kick Start Reagent \u00b6 Create a function main which does a reagent/render of your root reagent component main-panel : ( defn main-panel ;; my top level reagent component [] [ :div \"Hello DDATWD\" ]) ( defn ^ :export main ;; call this to bootstrap your app [] ( reagent.dom/render [ main-panel ] ( js/document.getElementById \"app\" ))) Mounting the top level component main-panel will trigger a cascade of child component creation. The full DOM tree will be rendered. 3. Loading Initial Data \u00b6 Let's rewrite our main-panel component to use a subscription. In effect, we want it to source and render some data held in app-db . First, we'll create the subscription handler: ( re-frame.core/reg-sub ;; a new subscription handler :name ;; usage (subscribe [:name]) ( fn [ db _ ] ( :display-name db ))) ;; extracts `:display-name` from app-db And now we use that subscription: ( defn main-panel [] ( let [ name ( re-frame.core/subscribe [ :name ])] ;; <--- a subscription <--- [ :div \"Hello \" @ name ]))) ;; <--- use the result of the subscription The user of our app will see funny things if that (subscribe [:name]) doesn't deliver good data. But how do we ensure \"good data\"? That will require: 1. getting data into app-db ; and 2. not get into trouble if that data isn't yet in app-db . For example, the data may have to come from a server and there's latency. Note: app-db initially contains {} Getting Data Into app-db Only event handlers can change app-db . Those are the rules!! Indeed, even initial values must be put in app-db via an event handler. Here's an event handler for that purpose: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :initialise-db ;; usage: (dispatch [:initialise-db]) ( fn [ _ _ ] ;; Ignore both params (db and event) { :display-name \"DDATWD\" ;; return a new value for app-db :items [ 1 2 3 4 ]})) You'll notice that this handler does nothing other than to return a map . That map will become the new value within app-db . We'll need to dispatch an :initialise-db event to get it to execute. main seems like the natural place: ( defn ^ :export main [] ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :initialise-db ]) ;; <--- this is new ( reagent.dom/render [ main-panel ] ( js/document.getElementById \"app\" ))) But remember, event handlers execute async. So although there's a dispatch within main , the event is simply queued, and the handler for :initialise-db will not be run until sometime after main has finished. But how long after? And is there a race condition? The component main-panel (which assumes good data) might be rendered before the :initialise-db event handler has put good data into app-db . We don't want any rendering (of main-panel ) until after app-db has been correctly initialised. Okay, so that's enough of teasing-out the issues. Let's see a quick sketch of the entire pattern. It is very straight-forward. The Pattern \u00b6 ( re-frame.core/reg-sub ;; supplied main-panel with data :name ;; usage (subscribe [:name]) ( fn [ db _ ] ( :display-name db ))) ( re-frame.core/reg-sub ;; we can check if there is data :initialised? ;; usage (subscribe [:initialised?]) ( fn [ db _ ] ( not ( empty? db )))) ;; do we have data ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :initialise-db ( fn [ db _ ] ( assoc db :display-name \"Jane Doe\" ))) ( defn main-panel ;; the top level of our app [] ( let [ name ( re-frame.core/subscribe [ :name ])] ;; we need there to be good data [ :div \"Hello \" @ name ]))) ( defn top-panel ;; this is new [] ( let [ ready? ( re-frame.core/subscribe [ :initialised? ])] ( if-not @ ready? ;; do we have good data? [ :div \"Initialising ...\" ] ;; tell them we are working on it [ main-panel ]))) ;; all good, render this component ( defn ^ :export main ;; call this to bootstrap your app [] ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :initialise-db ]) ( reagent.dom/render [ top-panel ] ( js/document.getElementById \"app\" ))) Scales Up \u00b6 This pattern scales up easily. For example, imagine a more complicated scenario in which your app is not fully initialised until 2 backend services supply data. Your main might look like this: ( defn ^ :export main ;; call this to bootstrap your app [] ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :initialise-db ]) ;; basics ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :load-from-service-1 ]) ;; ask for data from service-1 ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :load-from-service-2 ]) ;; ask for data from service-2 ( reagent.dom/render [ top-panel ] ( js/document.getElementById \"app\" ))) Your :initialised? test then becomes more like this sketch: ( re-frame.core/reg-sub :initialised? ;; usage (subscribe [:initialised?]) ( fn [ db _ ] ( and ( not ( empty? db )) ( :service1-answered? db ) ( :service2-answered? db ))))) This assumes boolean flags are set in app-db when data was loaded from these services. Cheating - Synchronous Dispatch \u00b6 In simple cases, you can simplify matters by using dispatch-sync (instead of dispatch ) in the main function. This technique can be seen in the TodoMVC Example . dispatch queues an event for later processing, but dispatch-sync acts like a function call and handles an event immediately. That's useful for initial data load we are considering, particularly for simple apps. Using dispatch-sync guarantees that initial state will be in place before any views are mounted, so we know they'll subscribe to sensible values. We don't need a guard like top-panel (introduced above). But don't get into the habit of using dispatch-sync everywhere. It is the right tool in this context and, sometimes, when writing tests, but dispatch is the staple you should use everywhere else. Loading Initial Data From Services \u00b6 Above, in our example main , we imagined using (re-frame/dispatch [:load-from-service-1]) to request data from a backend services.

Using = On Big Structures \u00b6 Reagent uses = to compare the previous value of a prop with the new value of that prop, when it determines if a component needs rerendering. Make sure you have a good understanding of this . In the worst case, if those props are big data structures which differ only in some tiny, leaf aspect, then a lot of CPU cycles will be spent doing the = comparison only to eventually work out that, indeed, the answer is false . This problem is exacerbated when components return a lot of hiccup, because lots of hiccup normally means lots of = work. Any rerender with those characteristics could end up chewing a lot of CPU cycles. An Example Of This Problem Imagine you were rendering a 19 by 19 \"Go\" board. And imagine that you have a high level board renderer component which creates hiccup for the 361 sub components (19 x 19 grid), and that it provides 3 props to each child: grid x cord grid y coord a chunk of data representing the current game state, from which each of the 361 individual grid components is expected to extract the data they need to render their grid position. This arrangement could be slow. First , you have a parent component returning hiccup for 361 sub-components and that's a lot of hiccup!! Sure, it might not be much code - just a couple of nested for , but the hiccup data structure built will be substantial. Second , after the board renderer returns all this hiccup, for every one of those 361 sub-components, Reagent must then check the 3 props to see if they are = to the value last rendered (to determine if they, in turn, need to be rerendered), and the comparison on the 3rd prop (game state) might be deep and expensive. Worse, we do the same expensive check 361 times in a row, and every time we get a false (because games state is not = to last time). Third , because Reagent gets 361 falses , it will further rerender all 361 sub-components even though 360 of them produce the same hiccup as last time - only one position in the grid has changed. So, when a new stone is placed on the board, and the game state changes, that triggers a large amount of unnecessary calculation, just to figure out that there's only a rendering change at one point in the 19x19 grid. So, that's how you can get a performance problem: lots of hiccup, mixed with time consuming = tests on big props. Solutions To This Problem The solution is to not do the unnecessary work. Duh! Produce only the hiccup that is needed. Don't unnecessarily pass around big complicated state in props, unless you really need to. In the Go example described above, for each new stone placed, only one point in the Go board actually needs to be rerendered, and yet our code asked Reagent to chew a lot of CPU to figure that out. These kinds of tweaks would improve performance: don't give the entire game state to each of the 361 sub components and then ask them to extract what they need. Instead, give each just the state it needs, and nothing more. That will make the = process faster. It will also allow for Reagent to figure out that 360 of the sub components have the same props as last time, and don't need rerendering. And, so, only one sub-component will be rerendered when the parent \"board level\" component rerenders. Also, could you render the board row by row? So that less hiccup is produced by any one component? Can those rows subscribe to just the data for their row, so they only rerender when the row-data changes; they only generate hiccup when something really has changed? 3. Are you Using a React key ? \u00b6 Correctly using React keys can also make a huge difference to performance.

It will appear to be a new function. React will conclude that it must replace this event handler. Most of the time, this is not an issue. But if you are generating a LOT of DOM this small inefficiency can add up. To work around the problem, lift the function generation out of the render.

When a handler hogs the CPU, nothing else can happen. Browsers only give us one thread of execution and that CPU-hogging handler owns it, and it isn't giving it up. The UI will be frozen and there will be no processing of any other handlers (eg: on-success of POSTs), etc, etc. Nothing. And a frozen UI is a problem. GUI repaints are not happening. And user interactions are not being processed. How are we to show progress updates like \"Hey, X% completed\"? Or how can we handle the user clicking on that \"Cancel\" button trying to stop this long running process? We need a means by which long running handlers can hand control back for \"other\" processing every so often, while still continuing on with their computation. The re-frame Solution \u00b6 First , all long running, CPU-hogging processes are put in event handlers. Not in subscriptions. Not in components. Not hard to do, but worth establishing as a rule, right up front. Second , you must be able to break up that CPU work into chunks. You need a way to do part of the work, pause, then resume from where you left off (more in a minute). In a perfect world, each chunk would take something like 16ms (60 fps). If you go longer, say 50ms or 100ms, it is no train smash, but UI responsiveness will degrade and animations, like busy spinners, will get jerky. Shorter is better, but less than 16ms delivers no added smoothness. Third , within our handler, after it completes one unit (chunk) of work, it should not continue straight on with the next. Instead, it should do a dispatch to itself and, in the event vector, include something like the following: a flag to say the work is not finished the working state so far; and what chunk to do next. A Sketch \u00b6 Here's an -fx handler which counts up to some number in chunks: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx :count-to ( fn [{ db :db } [ _ first-time so-far finish-at ]] ( if first-time ;; We are at the beginning, so: ;; - modify db, causing popup of Modal saying \"Working ...\" ;; - begin iterative dispatch. Give initial version of \"so-far\" { :dispatch [ :count-to false { :counter 0 } finish-at ] ;; dispatch to self :db ( assoc db :we-are-working true )} ( if ( > ( :counter so-far ) finish-at ) ;; We are finished: ;; - take away the state which causes the modal to be up ;; - store the result of the calculation { :db ( -> db ( assoc :fruits-of-labour ( :counter so-far )) ;; remember the result ( assoc :we-are-working false ))} ;; no more modal ;; Still more work to do ;; - run the calculation ;; - redispatch, passing in new running state ( let [ new-so-far ( update so-far :counter inc )] { :dispatch [ :count-to false new-so-far finish-at ]})))) Why Does A Redispatch Work? A dispatched event is handled asynchronously. It is queued and not actioned straight away. And here's the key: After handling current events, re-frame yields control to the browser , allowing it to render any pending DOM changes, etc. After it is finished, the browser will hand control back to the re-frame router loop, which will then handle any other queued events which, in our case, would include the event we just dispatched to perform the next chunk of work. When the next dispatch is handled, a next chunk of work will be done, and then another dispatch will happen. And so on. dispatch after dispatch . Chunk after chunk. In 16ms increments if we are very careful (or some small amount of time less than, say, 100ms). But with the browser getting a look-in after each iteration. Variations As we go, the handler could be updating some value in app-db which indicates progress, and this state would then be rendered into the UI. At a certain point, when all the work is done, the handler will likely put the fruits of its computational labour into app-db and clear any flags which might, for example, cause a modal dialog to be showing progress. And the process would then be done. Cancel Button It is a flexible pattern. For example, it can be tweaked to handle a \"Cancel' button ... If there was a \u201cCancel\u201d button to be clicked, we might (dispatch [:cancel-it]) and then have this event\u2019s handler tweak the app-db by adding :abandonment-required flags. When a chunk-processing-handler next begins, it could check for this :abandonment-required flag, and, if found, stop the CPU intensive process (and clear the abandonment flags). When the abandonment-flags are set, the UI could show \"Abandoning process ...\" and thus appear responsive to the user's click on \u201cCancel\u201d. That's just one approach. You can adapt the pattern as necessary. Further Notes Going to this trouble is completely unnecessary if the long running task involves I/O (GET, POST, HTML5 database action?) because the browser will handle I/O in another thread and give UI activities plenty of look in. You only need to go to this trouble if it is your code which is hogging the CPU. Forcing A One Off Render \u00b6 Imagine you have a process which takes, say, 5 seconds, and chunking is just too much effort. You lazily decide to leave the UI unresponsive for that short period. Except, you aren't totally lazy. If there was a button which kicked off this 5 second process, and the user clicks it, you\u2019d like the UI to show a response. Perhaps it could show a modal popup thing saying \u201cDoing X for you\u201d. At this point, you still have a small problem to solve. You want the UI to show your modal message before you then hog the CPU for 5 seconds. Updating the UI means altering app-db . Remember, the UI is a function of the data in app-db . Only changes to app-db cause UI changes. So, to show that Modal, you\u2019ll need to assoc some value into app-db and have that new value change what is rendered in your reagent components. You might be tempted to do this: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :process-x ( fn [ db event-v ] ( assoc db :processing-X true ) ;; update state, so reagent components render a modal ( do-long-process-x ))) ;; hog the CPU But that is just plain wrong. That assoc into db is not returned (and it must be for a -db handler). And, even if that did somehow work, then you continue hogging the thread with do-long-process-x . There's no chance for any UI updates because the handler never gives up control. This handler owns the thread right through. Ahhh, you think. I know what to do! I'll use that pattern I read about in the Wiki, and re-dispatch within an -fx handler: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx :process-x ( fn [{ db :db } event-v ] { :dispatch [ :do-work-process-x ] ;; do processing later, give CPU back to browser. :db ( assoc db :processing-X true )})) ;; so the modal gets rendered ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :do-work-process-x ( fn [ db _ ] ( do-long-process-x db ))) ;; return a new db, presumably containing work done So close. But it still won\u2019t work. There's a little wrinkle. That event handler for :process-x will indeed give back control to the browser. BUT, because of the way reagent works, that assoc on db won't trigger DOM updates until the next animation frame runs, which is 16ms away. So, you will be yielding control to the browser, but for next 16ms there won't appear to be anything to do. And, by then, your CPU hogging code will have got control back, and will keep control for the next 5 seconds. That nice little Dialog telling you the button was clicked and action is being taken won't show. In these kinds of cases, where you are only going to give the UI one chance to update (not a repeated chance every few milli seconds), then you had better be sure the DOM is fully synced. To do this, you put meta data on the event being dispatched: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx :process-x ( fn [{ db :db } event-v ] { :dispatch ^ :flush-dom [ :do-work-process-x ] ;; <--- NOW WITH METADATA :db ( assoc db :processing-X true )})) ;; so the modal gets rendered Notice the ^:flush-dom metadata on the event being dispatched. Use that when you want the UI to be fully updated before the event dispatch is handled. You only need this technique when you: want the DOM to be fully updated because you are going to hog the CPU for a while and not give it back. One chunk of work. If you handle via multiple chunks you don't have to do this, because you are repeatedly handing back control to the browser/UI. Its just when you are going to tie up the CPU for a one, longish chunk.","title":"Solve the CPU hog problem"},{"location":"Solve-the-CPU-hog-problem/#the-re-frame-solution","text":"First , all long running, CPU-hogging processes are put in event handlers.

You lazily decide to leave the UI unresponsive for that short period. Except, you aren't totally lazy. If there was a button which kicked off this 5 second process, and the user clicks it, you\u2019d like the UI to show a response. Perhaps it could show a modal popup thing saying \u201cDoing X for you\u201d. At this point, you still have a small problem to solve. You want the UI to show your modal message before you then hog the CPU for 5 seconds. Updating the UI means altering app-db . Remember, the UI is a function of the data in app-db . Only changes to app-db cause UI changes. So, to show that Modal, you\u2019ll need to assoc some value into app-db and have that new value change what is rendered in your reagent components. You might be tempted to do this: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :process-x ( fn [ db event-v ] ( assoc db :processing-X true ) ;; update state, so reagent components render a modal ( do-long-process-x ))) ;; hog the CPU But that is just plain wrong. That assoc into db is not returned (and it must be for a -db handler). And, even if that did somehow work, then you continue hogging the thread with do-long-process-x . There's no chance for any UI updates because the handler never gives up control. This handler owns the thread right through. Ahhh, you think. I know what to do! I'll use that pattern I read about in the Wiki, and re-dispatch within an -fx handler: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx :process-x ( fn [{ db :db } event-v ] { :dispatch [ :do-work-process-x ] ;; do processing later, give CPU back to browser. :db ( assoc db :processing-X true )})) ;; so the modal gets rendered ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db :do-work-process-x ( fn [ db _ ] ( do-long-process-x db ))) ;; return a new db, presumably containing work done So close. But it still won\u2019t work. There's a little wrinkle. That event handler for :process-x will indeed give back control to the browser. BUT, because of the way reagent works, that assoc on db won't trigger DOM updates until the next animation frame runs, which is 16ms away. So, you will be yielding control to the browser, but for next 16ms there won't appear to be anything to do. And, by then, your CPU hogging code will have got control back, and will keep control for the next 5 seconds. That nice little Dialog telling you the button was clicked and action is being taken won't show. In these kinds of cases, where you are only going to give the UI one chance to update (not a repeated chance every few milli seconds), then you had better be sure the DOM is fully synced. To do this, you put meta data on the event being dispatched: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx :process-x ( fn [{ db :db } event-v ] { :dispatch ^ :flush-dom [ :do-work-process-x ] ;; <--- NOW WITH METADATA :db ( assoc db :processing-X true )})) ;; so the modal gets rendered Notice the ^:flush-dom metadata on the event being dispatched. Use that when you want the UI to be fully updated before the event dispatch is handled. You only need this technique when you: want the DOM to be fully updated because you are going to hog the CPU for a while and not give it back. One chunk of work. If you handle via multiple chunks you don't have to do this, because you are repeatedly handing back control to the browser/UI. Its just when you are going to tie up the CPU for a one, longish chunk.","title":"Forcing A One Off Render"},{"location":"Subscribing-To-External-Data/","text":"This document will soon be retired, and you probably shouldn't be reading it. It may mislead you. It documents an approach we experiemented with early, before realising it was probably wrong, but we haven't yet transfered the knowledge it contains to some other, less central place. So here is still sits. The RIGHT WAY in think can be found in FAQs like: 1. https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/FAQs/LoadOnMount.md 2. https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/FAQs/PollADatabaseEvery60.md 3. https://github.com/day8/re-frame-http-fx Subscribing to External Data \u00b6 In Talking To Servers we learned how to communicate with servers using both pure and effectful handlers. This is great, but what if you want to query external data using subscriptions the same way you query data stored in app-db ? This tutorial will show you how. There Can Be Only One!! re-frame apps have a single source of data called app-db . The re-frame README asks you to imagine app-db as something of an in-memory database. You query it (via subscriptions) and transactionally update it (via event handlers). Components Don't Know, Don't Care Components never know the structure of your app-db , much less its existence. Instead, they subscribe , declaratively, to data, like this (subscribe [:something \"blah\"]) , and that allows Components to obtain a stream of updates to \"something\", while knowing nothing about the source of the data. A 2nd Source All good but ... SPAs are seldom completely self contained data-wise. There's a continuum between apps which are 100% standalone data-wise, and those where remote data is utterly central to the app's function. In this page, we're exploring the remote-data-centric end of this continuum. And just to be clear, when I'm talking about remote data, I'm thinking of data luxuriating in remote databases like firebase, rethinkdb, PostgreSQL, Datomic, etc - data sources that an app must query and mutate. So, the question is: how would we integrate this kind of remote data into an app when re-frame seems to have only one source of data: app-db ? How do we introduce a second or even third source of data? How should we subscribe to this remote data, and how would we update it? By way of explanation, let's make the question specific: how could we wire up a Component which displays a collection of items , when those items come from a remote database? In your mind's eye, imagine this kind of query against that remote database: select id, price, description from items where type=\"see through\" . Via A Subscription In re-frame , Components always obtain data via a subscription. Always. So, our Component which shows items is going to ( let [ items ( re-frame/subscribe [ :items \"see through\" ]) ... and the subscription handler will deliver them. Which, in turn, means our code must have a subscription handler defined: ( re-frame/reg-sub :items ( fn [ db [ _ item-type ] ... )) Which is fine ... except we haven't really solved this problem yet, have we? We've just transferred the problem away from the Component and into the subscription handler? Well, yes, we have, and isn't that a fine thing!! That's precisely what we want from our subscription handlers ... to manage how the data is sourced ... to hide that from the Component. The Subscription Handler's Job Right, so let's write the subscription handler. There'll be code in a minute but, first, let's describe how the subscription handler will work: Upon being required to provide items, it has to issue a query to the remote database. Perhaps this will be done via a RESTful GET. Or via a firebase connection. Or by pushing a JSON representation of the query down a websocket. Something. And it is the subscription handler's job to know how it is done. This query be async - with the results arriving sometime \"later\". And when they eventually arrive, the handler must organise for the query results to be placed into app-db , at some known, particular path. In the meantime, the handler might want to ensure that the absence of results is also communicated to the Component, allowing it to display \"Loading ...\". The Nine States of Design has some useful information on designing your application for different states that your data might be in. The subscription handler must return something to the Component. It should give back a reaction to that known, particular path within app-db , so that when the query results eventually arrive, they will flow through into the Component for display. The subscription handler will detect when the Component is destroyed and no longer requires the subscription. It will then clean up, getting rid of those now-unneeded items, and sorting out any stateful database connection issues. Notice what's happening here. In many respects, app-db is still acting as the single source of data. The subscription handler is organising for the right remote data to \"flow\" into app-db at a known, particular path, when it is needed by a Component. And, equally, for this data to be cleaned up when it is no longer required. Some Code Enough fluffing about with words, here's a code sketch for our subscription handler: ( re-frame/reg-sub-raw :items ( fn [ app-db [ _ type ]] ( let [ query-token ( issue-items-query! type :on-success # ( re-frame/dispatch [ :write-to [ :some :path ]]))] ( reagent.ratom/make-reaction ( fn [] ( get-in @ app-db [ :some :path ])) :on-dispose # ( do ( terminate-items-query! query-token ) ( re-frame/dispatch [ :cleanup [ :some :path ]])))))) A few things to notice: We are using the low level reg-sub-raw to register our handler (and not the more normal reg-sub ) so we can get an :on-dispose callback when the subscription is no longer needed. See the reg-sub-raw docs at the end of this tutorial You have to write issue-items-query! . Are you making a Restful GET? Are you writing JSON packets down a websocket? The query has to be made. We do not issue the query via a dispatch because, to me, it isn't an event. But we most certainly do handle the arrival of query results via a dispatch and associated event handler. That to me is an external event happening to the system. The event handler can curate the arriving data in whatever way makes sense. Maybe it does nothing more than to assoc into an app-db path, or maybe this is a rethinkdb changefeed subscription and your event handler will have to collate the newly arriving data with what has previously been returned. Do what needs to be done in that event handler, so that the right data will be put into the right path. We use Reagent's make-reaction function to create a reaction which will return that known, particular path within app-db where the query results are to be placed. We use the on-dispose callback on this reaction to do any cleanup work when the subscription is no longer needed. Clean up app-db ? Clean up the database connection? Any Good? It turns out that this is a surprisingly flexible and clean approach. And pretty damn obvious once someone points it out to you (which is a good sign). There's a lot to like about it. For example, if you are using rethinkdb, which supports queries which yield \"change feeds\" over time, rather than a one-off query result, you have to actively close such queries when they are no longer needed. That's easy to do in our cleanup code. We can source some data from both PostgreSQL and firebase in the one app, using the same pattern. All remote data access is done in the same way. Because query results are dispatched to an event handler, you have a lot of flexibility about how you process them. The whole set of pieces can be arranged and tweaked in many ways. For example, with a bit of work, we could keep a register of all currently used queries. And then, if ever we noticed that the app had gone offline, and then back online, we could organise to reissue all the queries again (with results flowing back into the same known paths), avoiding stale results. Also, notice that putting ALL interesting data into app-db has nice flow on effects. In particular, it means it is available to event handlers, should they need it when servicing events (event handlers get db as a parameter, right?). If this item data was held in a separate place, other than app-db , it wouldn't be available in this useful way. Warning: Undo/Redo This technique caches remote data in app-db . Be sure to exclude this cache area from any undo/redo operations using the available configuration options Query De-duplication In v0.8.0 of re-frame onwards, subscriptions are automatically de-duplicated. In prior versions, in cases where the same query is simultaneously issued from multiple places, you'd want to de-duplicate the queries. One possibility is to do this duplication in issue-items-query! itself. You can count the duplicate queries and only clear the data when that count goes to 0. Thanks To @nidu for his valuable review comments and insights The Alternative Approach \u00b6 Event handlers do most of the heavy lifting within re-frame apps. When buttons get clicked, or items get dragged 'n dropped, or tabs get chosen, they know how to transition the app from one state to the next. That's their job. And, when they make such a transition, it is quite reasonable to expect them to ALSO source the data needed in the new state. So there's definitely a case for NOT using the approach outlined above and, instead, making event handlers source data and plonk it into a certain part of app-db for use by subscriptions. In effect, there's definitely an argument that subscriptions should only ever source from app-db BUT that it is event handlers which start and stop the sourcing of data from remote places. Sorry, but you'll have to work out which of these two variations works best for you. Within this document the first alternative has been given more word count only because there's a few more tricks to make it work, not because it is necessarily preferred. Absolutely Never Do This \u00b6 Sometimes, because of their background with other JS frameworks, new re-framians feel like the Components themselves (the views) should have the responsibility of sourcing the data they need. They then use React lifecycle methods like :component-did-mount to load remote data. I believe this is absolutely the wrong way to do it.

We'll assume there's a json-returning server endpoint at \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\". We want to GET from that endpoint and put a processed version of the returned json into app-db . Triggering The Request \u00b6 The user often does something to trigger the process. Here's a button which the user could click: ( defn request-it-button [] [ :div { :class \"button-class\" :on-click # ( dispatch [ :request-it ])} ;; get data from the server !! \"I want it, now!\" ]) Notice the on-click handler - it dispatch es the event [:request-it] . The Event Handler \u00b6 That :request-it event will need to be \"handled\", which means an event handler must be registered for it. We want this handler to: 1. Initiate the HTTP GET 2. Update a flag in app-db which will trigger a modal \"Loading ...\" message for the user to see We're going to create two versions of this event handler. First, we'll create a problematic version of the event handler and then, realising our sins, we'll write a second version which is a soaring paragon of virtue. Both versions will teach us something. Version 1 We're going to use the cljs-ajax library as the HTTP workhorse. Here's the event handler: ( ns my.app.events ;; <1> ( :require [ ajax.core :refer [ GET ]] [ re-frame.core :refer [ reg-event-db ])) ( reg-event-db ;; <-- register an event handler :request-it ;; <-- the event id ( fn ;; <-- the handler function [ db _ ] ;; kick off the GET, making sure to supply a callback for success and failure ( GET \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\" { :handler # ( dispatch [ :process-response %1 ]) ;; <2> further dispatch !! :error-handler # ( dispatch [ :bad-response %1 ])}) ;; <2> further dispatch !! ;; update a flag in `app-db` ... presumably to cause a \"Loading...\" UI ( assoc db :loading? true ))) ;; <3> return an updated db Further Notes: 1. Event handlers are normally put into an events.cljs namespace 2. Notice that the GET callbacks issue a further dispatch . Such callbacks should never attempt to close over db themselves, or make any changes to it because, by the time these callbacks happen, the value in app-db may have changed. Whereas, if they dispatch , then the event handlers looking after the event they dispatch will be given the latest copy of the db. 3. event handlers registered using reg-event-db must return a new value for app-db . In our case, we set a flag which will presumably cause a \"Loading ...\" UI to show. Successful GET As we noted above, the on-success handler itself is just #(dispatch [:process-response RESPONSE]) . So we'll need to register a handler for this event too. Like this: ( reg-event-db :process-response ( fn [ db [ _ response ]] ;; destructure the response from the event vector ( -> db ( assoc :loading? false ) ;; take away that \"Loading ...\" UI ( assoc :data ( js->clj response )))) ;; fairly lame processing A normal handler would have more complex processing of the response. But we're just sketching here, so we've left it easy. There'd also need to be a handler for the :bad-response event too. Left as an exercise. Problems In Paradise? This approach will work, and it is useful to take time to understand why it would work, but it has a problem: the event handler isn't pure. That GET is a side effect, and side effecting functions are like a well salted paper cut. We try hard to avoid them. Version 2 The better solution is, of course, to use an effectful handler. This is explained in detail in the previous tutorials: Effectful Handlers and Effects . In the 2nd version, we use the alternative registration function, reg-event-fx , and we'll use an \"Effect Handler\" supplied by this library https://github.com/day8/re-frame-http-fx .

What To Test \u00b6 For any re-frame app, there's three things to test: Event Handlers - most of your testing focus will be here because this is where most of the logic lives Subscription Handlers - often not a lot to test here. Only Layer 3 subscriptions need testing. View functions - I don't tend to write tests for views. There, I said it. Hey! It is mean to look at someone with that level of disapproval, while shaking your head. I have my reasons ... In my experience with the re-frame architecture, View Functions tend to be an unlikely source of bugs. And every line of code you write is like a ball & chain you must forevermore drag about, so I dislike maintaining tests which don't deliver good bang for buck. And, yes, in theory there's also Effect Handlers (Domino 3) to test, but you'll hardly ever write one, and, anyway, each one is different, so I've got no good general insight to offer you for them. They will be ignored in this tutorial. Test Terminology \u00b6 Let's establish some terminology to aid the further explanations in this tutorial. Every unittest has 3 steps: setup initial conditions execute the thing-under-test verify that the thing-under-test did the right thing Exposing Event Handlers For Test \u00b6 Event Handlers are pure functions which should make them easy to test, right? First, create a named event handler using defn like this: ( defn select-triangle [ db [ _ triangle-id ]] ... return a modified version of db ) You'd register this handler in a separate step: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-db ;; this is a \"-db\" event handler, not \"-fx\" :select-triangle [ some-interceptors ] select-triangle ) ;; <--- defn above. don't use an annonomous fn This arrangement means the event handler function select-triangle is readily available to be unittested. Event Handlers - Setup - Part 1 \u00b6 To test select-triangle , a unittest must pass in values for the two arguments db and v . And, so, our setup would have to construct both values. But how to create a useful db value? db is a map of a certain structure, so one way would be to simply assoc values into a map at certain paths to simulate a real-world db value or, even easier, just use a map literal, like this: ;; a test ( let [ ;; setup - create db and event db { :some 42 :thing \"hello\" } ; a literal event [ :select-triangle :other :event :args ] ;; execute result-db ( select-triange db event )] ;; validate that result-db is correct) ( is ... ) This certainly works in theory, but in practice, unless we are careful, constructing the db value in setup could: be manual and time consuming tie tests to the internal structure of app-db The setup of every test could end up relying on the internal structure of app-db and any change in that structure (which is inevitable over time) would result in a lot re-work in the tests. That's too fragile. So, this approach doesn't quite work. Event Handlers - Setup - Part 2 \u00b6 In re-frame, Events are central. They are the \"language of the system\". They provide the eloquence. The db value (stored in app-db ) is the cumulative result of many event handlers running. We can use this idea. In setup , instead of manually trying to create that db value, we could \"build up\" a db value by threading db through many event handlers which cumulatively create the required initial state. Tests then need know nothing about the internal structure of that db . Like this: ( let [ ;; setup - cummulatively build up db db ( -> {} ;; empty db ( initialise-db [ :initialise-db ]) ;; each event handler expects db and event ( clear-panel [ :clear-panel ]) ( draw-triangle [ :draw-triangle 1 2 3 ])) event [ :select-triange :other :stuff ] ;; now execute the event handler under test db ' ( select-triange db event )] ;; validate that db' is correct ( is ... ) This approach works so long as all the event handlers are of the -db kind, but the threading gets a little messy when some event handlers are of the -fx kind which take a coeffect argument and return effects , instead of a db value. So, this approach is quite workable in some cases, but can get messy in the general case. Event Handlers - Setup - Part 3 \u00b6 There is further variation which is quite general but not as pure. During test setup we could literally just dispatch the events which would put app-db into the right state. Except, we'd have to use dispatch-sync rather dispatch to force immediate handling of events, rather than queuing. ;; setup - cummulatively build up db ( dispatch-sync [ :initialise-db ]) ( dispatch-sync [ :clear-panel ]) ( dispatch-sync [ :draw-triangle 1 2 3 ]) ;; execute ( dispatch-sync [ :select-triange :other :stuff ]) ;; validate that the value in 'app-db' is correct ;; perhaps with subscriptions Notes: we use dispatch-sync because dispatch is async (event is handled not now, but soon) Not pure. We are choosing to mutate the global app-db . But having said that, there's something about this approach which is remarkably pragmatic. the setup is now very natural. The associated handlers can be either -db or -fx if the handlers have effects other than just updating app-db, we might need to stub out XXX How do we look at the results ???? If this method appeals to you, you should ABSOLUTELY review the utilities in this helper library: re-frame-test . In summary, event handlers should be easy to test because they are pure functions. The interesting part is the unittest \"setup\" where we need to establish an initial value for db . Subscription Handlers \u00b6 Here's a Subscription Handler from the todomvc example : ( reg-sub :visible-todos ;; signal function ( fn [ query-v _ ] [( subscribe [ :todos ]) ( subscribe [ :showing ])]) ;; computation function ( fn [[ todos showing ] _ ] ;; that 1st parameter is a 2-vector of values ( let [ filter-fn ( case showing :active ( complement :done ) :done :done :all identity )] ( filter filter-fn todos )))) How do we test this? First, we could split the computation function from its registration, like this: ( defn visible-todos [[ todos showing ] _ ] ( let [ filter-fn ( case showing :active ( complement :done ) :done :done :all identity )] ( filter filter-fn todos ))) ( reg-sub :visible-todos ( fn [ query-v _ ] [( subscribe [ :todos ]) ( subscribe [ :showing ])]) visible-todos ) ;; <--- computation function used here That makes visible-todos available for direct unit testing. But, as we experienced with Event Handlers, the challenge is around constructing db values (first parameter) in a way which doesn't become fragile. View Functions - Part 1 \u00b6 Components/views are more tricky and there are a few options. But remember my ugly secret - I don't tend to write tests for my views. But here's how, theoretically, I'd write tests if I wasn't me ... If a View Function is Form-1 , then it is fairly easy to test. A trivial example: ( defn greet [ name ] [ :div \"Hello \" name ]) ( greet \"Wiki\" ) ;;=> [:div \"Hello \" \"Wiki\"] So, here, testing involves passing values into the function and checking the data structure returned for correctness. What's returned is hiccup, of course. So how do you test hiccup for correctness? hiccup is just a clojure data structure - vectors containing keywords, and maps, and other vectors, etc. Perhaps you'd use https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter to declaratively check on the presence of certain values and structures? Or do it more manually. View Functions - Part 2A \u00b6 But what if the View Function has a subscription? ( defn my-view [ something ] ( let [ val ( subscribe [ :query-id ])] ;; <-- reactive subscription [ :div .... using @ val in here ])) The use of subscribe makes the function impure (it obtains data from places other than its args). A testing plan might be: setup app-db with some values in the right places (via dispatch of events?) call my-view (with a parameter) which will return hiccup check the hiccup structure for correctness. Continuing on, in a second phase you could then: change the value in app-db (which will cause the subscription to fire) call view functions again (hiccup returned) check the new hiccup for correctness. Which is all possible, if a little messy. View Functions - Part 2B \u00b6 There is a pragmatic method available to handle the impurity: use with-redefs to stub out subscribe . Like this: ( defn subscription-stub [ x ] ( atom ( case x [ :query-id ] 42 ))) ( deftest some-test ( with-redefs [ re-frame/subscribe ( subscription-stub )] ( testing \"some some view which does a subscribe\" ..... call the view function and the hiccup output ))) For more integration level testing, you can use with-mounted-component from the reagent-template to render the component in the browser and validate the generated DOM. View Functions - Part 2C \u00b6 Or ... there is another option: you can structure in the first place for pure view functions. The trick here is to create an outer and inner component. The outer sources the data (via a subscription), and passes it onto the inner as props (parameters). As a result, the inner component, which does the testable work, is pure and easily tested. The outer is impure but trivial. To get a more concrete idea, I'll direct you to another page in the re-frame docs which has nothing to do with testing, but it does use this simple-outer-subscribe-with-complicated-inner-render pattern for a different purpose: Using Stateful JS Components Note: this technique could be made simple and almost invisible via the use of macros.

They are the \"language of the system\". They provide the eloquence. The db value (stored in app-db ) is the cumulative result of many event handlers running. We can use this idea. In setup , instead of manually trying to create that db value, we could \"build up\" a db value by threading db through many event handlers which cumulatively create the required initial state. Tests then need know nothing about the internal structure of that db . Like this: ( let [ ;; setup - cummulatively build up db db ( -> {} ;; empty db ( initialise-db [ :initialise-db ]) ;; each event handler expects db and event ( clear-panel [ :clear-panel ]) ( draw-triangle [ :draw-triangle 1 2 3 ])) event [ :select-triange :other :stuff ] ;; now execute the event handler under test db ' ( select-triange db event )] ;; validate that db' is correct ( is ... ) This approach works so long as all the event handlers are of the -db kind, but the threading gets a little messy when some event handlers are of the -fx kind which take a coeffect argument and return effects , instead of a db value.

But it doesn't matter - the wickedness of the temptation is too much. The JS world is brimming with shiny component baubles: D3, Google Maps, Chosen, etc. But they are salaciously stateful and mutative. And, you, raised in a pure, functional home, with caring, immutable parents, know they are wrong. But, my, how you still yearn for the sweet thrill of that forbidden fruit. I won't tell, if you don't. But careful plans must be made ... The overall plan \u00b6 To use a stateful js component, you'll need to write two Reagent components: an outer component responsible for sourcing data via a subscription or r/atom or cursor, etc. an inner component responsible for wrapping and manipulating the stateful JS component via lifecycle functions. The pattern involves the outer component, which sources data, supplying this data to the inner component via props . Example Using Google Maps \u00b6 ( defn gmap-inner [] ( let [ gmap ( atom nil ) options ( clj->js { \"zoom\" 9 }) update ( fn [ comp ] ( let [{ :keys [ latitude longitude ]} ( reagent/props comp ) latlng ( js/google.maps.LatLng. latitude longitude )] ( .setPosition ( :marker @ gmap ) latlng ) ( .panTo ( :map @ gmap ) latlng )))] ( reagent/create-class { :reagent-render ( fn [] [ :div [ :h4 \"Map\" ] [ :div#map-canvas { :style { :height \"400px\" }}]]) :component-did-mount ( fn [ comp ] ( let [ canvas ( .getElementById js/document \"map-canvas\" ) gm ( js/google.maps.Map. canvas options ) marker ( js/google.maps.Marker. ( clj->js { :map gm :title \"Drone\" }))] ( reset! gmap { :map gm :marker marker })) ( update comp )) :component-did-update update :display-name \"gmap-inner\" }))) ( defn gmap-outer [] ( let [ pos ( subscribe [ :current-position ])] ;; obtain the data ( fn [] ;; Note: @pos is a map here, so it gets passed as props. ;; Non-props values can be accessed via (reagent/argv comp) [ gmap-inner @ pos ]))) Notes: gmap-outer obtains data via a subscription. It is quite simple - trivial almost. it then passes this data as a prop to gmap-inner . This inner component has the job of wrapping/managing the stateful js component (Gmap in our case above) when the data (delivered by the subscription) to the outer layer changes, the inner layer, gmap-inner , will be given a new prop - @pos in the case above. when the inner component is given new props, its entire set of lifecycle functions will be engaged. the renderer for the inner layer ALWAYS renders the same, minimal container hiccup for the component. Even though the props have changed, the same hiccup is output. So it will appear to React as if nothing changes from one render to the next. No work to be done. React/Reagent will leave the DOM untouched. but this inner component has other lifecycle functions and this is where the real work is done. for example, after the renderer is called (which ignores its props), component-did-update will be called. In this function, we don't ignore the props, and we use them to update/mutate the stateful JS component. the props passed (in this case @pos ) in must be a map, otherwise (reagent/props comp) will return nil.

You program in a LISP by creating and assembling LISP data structures. The syntax is data literals. Dwell on that for a moment. You are programming in data . The functions which later transform data, themselves start as data. So, Clojurists place particular emphasis on the primacy of data. They meditate on aphorisms like data is the ultimate in late binding . They exalt inequalities like data > functions > macros . (Disappointingly, they also re-watch Rich Hickey videos a bit too much, and wish that their hair was darker and more curly.) I cannot stress enough what a big deal this is. It will seem like a syntax curiosity at first but, when the penny drops for you on this, it tends to be a profound moment. So, it will come as no surprise, then, to find that re-frame has a data-oriented design. Events are data. Effects are data. DOM is data. The functions which transform data are registered and looked up via data. Interceptors (data) are preferred to middleware (higher order functions). Etc. And re-frame apps are reactive which further elevates data because in reactive systems, it is the arrival of data which coordinates the calling of functions , not the other way around. Data - that's the way we roll. The Data Loop \u00b6 Architecturally, re-frame implements \"a perpetual loop\". To build an app, you hang pure functions on certain parts of this loop, and re-frame looks after the conveyance of data around the loop, into and out of the transforming functions you provide. The tag line for re-frame is \"derived values, flowing\". Remember this diagram from school? The water cycle, right? Two distinct stages, involving water in different phases, being acted upon by different forces: gravity working one way, evaporation and convection the other. To understand re-frame, imagine data flowing around that loop instead of water . re-frame provides the conveyance of the data around the loop - the equivalent of gravity, evaporation and convection. You design what's flowing, and then you hang functions on the loop at various points to compute the data's phase changes. Sure, right now, you're thinking \"lazy sod - make a proper Computer Science-y diagram\". But, no. Joe Armstrong says \"don't break the laws of physics\" - I'm sure you've seen the videos - and if he says to do something, you do it (unless Rich Hickey disagrees, and says to do something else). So, this diagram, apart from being a plausible analogy which might help you to understand re-frame, is practically proof it does physics. Six Dominoes \u00b6 Each iteration of the re-frame loop has 6 stages, and because these stages happen one after the other, we talk about this process as a six domino cascade. One domino triggers the next, which triggers the next, boom, boom, boom, until we are back at the beginning of the loop, and the dominoes reset to attention again, ready for the next iteration of the same cascade. The six dominoes are: Event dispatch Event handling Effect handling Query View DOM Let's begin by looking at each of them from a great height - maybe from 60,000 feet . 1st Domino - Event Dispatch \u00b6 An event is sent when something happens - the user clicks a button, or a websocket receives a new message. Without the impulse of a triggering event , no six domino cascade occurs. It is only because of events that a re-frame app is propelled, loop iteration after loop iteration, from one state to the next. re-frame is event driven. 2nd Domino - Event Handling \u00b6 In response to an event , an application must decide what action to take. This is known as event handling . Event handler functions compute how an event should change \"the world\", which is to say that they compute the side effects of the event. Or, more accurately, they compute a declarative description of the required side effects - represented as data. So event handlers are just functions which compute data, and that data describes what needs to happen. Much of the time, an event will only cause side effects to \"application state\", but sometimes the outside world must also be affected: localstore, cookies, databases, emails, logs, etc. 3rd Domino - Effect Handling \u00b6 In this step, the side effects , calculated by the previous step, are actioned. Data gets turned into action and the world is mutated. Now, to a functional programmer, effects are scary in a xenomorph kind of way. Nothing messes with functional purity quite like the need for side effects. On the other hand, effects are marvelous because they move the app forward. Without them, an app stays stuck in one state forever, never achieving anything. So re-frame embraces the protagonist nature of effects - the entire, unruly zoo of them - but it does so in a controlled and largely hidden way, and in a manner which is debuggable, auditable, mockable and pluggable. We're Now At A Pivot Point \u00b6 Domino 3 just changed the world and, very often, one particular part of it: the application state . re-frame's application state is held in one place - think of it like you would an in-memory, central database for the app (details soon). Any changes to application state trigger the next part of the cascade involving dominoes 4-5-6. There's a Formula For It \u00b6 The 4-5-6 domino cascade implements the formula made famous by Facebook's ground-breaking React library: v = f(s) A view, v , is a function, f , of the app state, s . Said another way, there are functions f that compute which DOM nodes, v , should be displayed to the user when the application is in a given app state, s . Or, to capture the dynamics we'd say: over time , as s changes, f will be re-run each time to compute new v , forever keeping v up to date with the current s . Or, with yet another emphasis: over time what is presented to the user changes in response to application state changes. In our case, domino 3 changes s , the application state, and, in response, dominoes 4-5-6 are concerned with re-running f to compute the new v shown to the user. Except, there's no single f to run. There are many f which collectively build the overall v . And only a certain part of s may have changed, meaning only a subset of the f need rerun, to re-compute a subset of v . Domino 4 - Query \u00b6 Domino 4 is about extracting data from \"app state\", and providing it in the right format for the ViewFunctions of domino 5. Domino 4 is a novel and efficient de-duplicated Signal Graph which runs query functions on the app state, efficiently computing reactive, multi-layered, \"materialised views\" of it. Please relax about any unfamiliar terminology, you'll soon see how simple the code is in practice. Domino 5 - View \u00b6 Domino 5 is many ViewFunctions (aka Reagent components) which collectively render the UI of the application. Each ViewFunction renders part of the whole. These functions compute and return data in a format called hiccup which represents DOM. To render the right DOM, ViewFunctions must obtain state using the signal graph of domino 4. They use a subscribe facility which reactively delivers this state. They automatically re-run in response to changes in the Signal Graph, keeping the UI up to date. So, after the application state changes in domino 3, data flows through the Signal Graph of domino 4, causing the ViewFunctions to re-render the UI presented to the user. Domino 6 - DOM \u00b6 You don't write Domino 6 - it is handled for you by Reagent/React. I mention it here for completeness and to fully close the loop.

The browser DOM nodes are mutated.","title":"A Data Loop"},{"location":"a-loop/#homoiconic","text":"ClojureScript is a modern LISP, and LISPs are homoiconic . You program in a LISP by creating and assembling LISP data structures. The syntax is data literals. Dwell on that for a moment. You are programming in data . The functions which later transform data, themselves start as data. So, Clojurists place particular emphasis on the primacy of data. They meditate on aphorisms like data is the ultimate in late binding . They exalt inequalities like data > functions > macros . (Disappointingly, they also re-watch Rich Hickey videos a bit too much, and wish that their hair was darker and more curly.) I cannot stress enough what a big deal this is. It will seem like a syntax curiosity at first but, when the penny drops for you on this, it tends to be a profound moment. So, it will come as no surprise, then, to find that re-frame has a data-oriented design. Events are data. Effects are data. DOM is data. The functions which transform data are registered and looked up via data. Interceptors (data) are preferred to middleware (higher order functions). Etc. And re-frame apps are reactive which further elevates data because in reactive systems, it is the arrival of data which coordinates the calling of functions , not the other way around. Data - that's the way we roll.","title":"Homoiconic"},{"location":"a-loop/#the-data-loop","text":"Architecturally, re-frame implements \"a perpetual loop\". To build an app, you hang pure functions on certain parts of this loop, and re-frame looks after the conveyance of data around the loop, into and out of the transforming functions you provide. The tag line for re-frame is \"derived values, flowing\". Remember this diagram from school? The water cycle, right? Two distinct stages, involving water in different phases, being acted upon by different forces: gravity working one way, evaporation and convection the other. To understand re-frame, imagine data flowing around that loop instead of water . re-frame provides the conveyance of the data around the loop - the equivalent of gravity, evaporation and convection. You design what's flowing, and then you hang functions on the loop at various points to compute the data's phase changes. Sure, right now, you're thinking \"lazy sod - make a proper Computer Science-y diagram\". But, no. Joe Armstrong says \"don't break the laws of physics\" - I'm sure you've seen the videos - and if he says to do something, you do it (unless Rich Hickey disagrees, and says to do something else). So, this diagram, apart from being a plausible analogy which might help you to understand re-frame, is practically proof it does physics.","title":"The Data Loop"},{"location":"a-loop/#six-dominoes","text":"Each iteration of the re-frame loop has 6 stages, and because these stages happen one after the other, we talk about this process as a six domino cascade.

This is known as event handling . Event handler functions compute how an event should change \"the world\", which is to say that they compute the side effects of the event. Or, more accurately, they compute a declarative description of the required side effects - represented as data. So event handlers are just functions which compute data, and that data describes what needs to happen. Much of the time, an event will only cause side effects to \"application state\", but sometimes the outside world must also be affected: localstore, cookies, databases, emails, logs, etc.","title":"2nd Domino - Event Handling"},{"location":"a-loop/#3rd-domino-effect-handling","text":"In this step, the side effects , calculated by the previous step, are actioned. Data gets turned into action and the world is mutated. Now, to a functional programmer, effects are scary in a xenomorph kind of way. Nothing messes with functional purity quite like the need for side effects. On the other hand, effects are marvelous because they move the app forward. Without them, an app stays stuck in one state forever, never achieving anything. So re-frame embraces the protagonist nature of effects - the entire, unruly zoo of them - but it does so in a controlled and largely hidden way, and in a manner which is debuggable, auditable, mockable and pluggable.","title":"3rd Domino - Effect Handling"},{"location":"a-loop/#were-now-at-a-pivot-point","text":"Domino 3 just changed the world and, very often, one particular part of it: the application state . re-frame's application state is held in one place - think of it like you would an in-memory, central database for the app (details soon).

Or, to capture the dynamics we'd say: over time , as s changes, f will be re-run each time to compute new v , forever keeping v up to date with the current s . Or, with yet another emphasis: over time what is presented to the user changes in response to application state changes. In our case, domino 3 changes s , the application state, and, in response, dominoes 4-5-6 are concerned with re-running f to compute the new v shown to the user. Except, there's no single f to run.

Because all app state is coalesced into one atom, it can be updated with a single reset! , which acts like a transactional commit. There is an instant in which the app goes from one state to the next, never a series of incremental steps which can leave the app in a temporarily inconsistent, intermediate state. Again, this simplicity causes a certain class of bugs or design problems to evaporate. The data in app-db can be given a strong schema so that, at any moment, we can validate all the data in the application. All of it! We do this check after every single \"event handler\" runs (event handlers compute new state). And this enables us to catch errors early (and accurately).

Open an issue with your thoughts at the re-freame repo or via twitter here Many Thanks! Are you new to ClojureScript? This page will teach you to read Clojure in 20 minutes. Specifically, it will teach you enough to read Reagent and re-frame code (building Web UIs). Learning to write ClojureScript is a larger skill, which will require more than 20 mins, but this page does contain some interactive, live coding to get you started. In A Nutshell, Why? \u00b6 Clojure is a modern LISP. Alan Kay once descibed LISP as \"Maxwell's equations of software\". Paul Graham says LISP was a competitive advantage for his startup. Dijkstra has written glowingly of it. For 50 years, some of the finest minds in software have admired it, used it and refined it. In the years leading up to 2010, Rich Hickey created Clojure, introducing a number of key inovations (later adopted by other functional languages), and he did it well away from acedemia, because he wanted to create a pragmatic language for commercial developers. Overall, Clojure is a foliated masterpiece. As the owner of a company which develops software products, I believe ClojureScript gives us a competitive edge. As a programmer, I feel like it has provided me with excellent, nourishing brain food. It is a stable, productive place, with little churn. In contrast, when I look across to the Javascript landscape, it appears like a churning washing machine with not much new or interesting to teach me. Learning a LISP will likely make you better developer for life, even if you aren't using LISP. Clojure runs on the JVM. ClojureScript runs in the browser. They are essentially the same language but our focus is ClojureScript. So, 20 mins ... I have good news: you are going to be surprised and delighted at the simplicity of the syntax. Simple Data Literals \u00b6 Type Example Comment character \\a The letter a number 1 number 3.14 string \"hello\" nil nil aka null, None Collection Data Literals \u00b6 Lists use () , vectors use [] , hashmaps use {} and sets use # {} , Exanples: Collection Example Comment list ( 1 2 3 ) Empty list is () No commas necessary. But, if present, treated as whitespace. list ( 1 2 \"yes\" ) Can be heterogeneous. vector [ 1 2 3 ] Again, no commas necessary. Empty vector is [] vector [ 1 \"hello\" \\x nil ] Can be heterogeneous. hashmap { 1 \"Hello\" } A dictionary, or hashmap. Each pair is a key and a value . One pair in this example. 1 is key, \"hello\" is the value hashmap { 1 \"Hello\" 2 nil } No delimiter necessary between pairs. Two key/value pairs in this example. hashmap { 1 \"Hello\" \\b 27 \"pi\" 3.14 } Can be heterogeneous. Still no commas between pairs. set # { 1 \"Hello\" \\a } Can be heterogeneous. Still no commas between pairs. Collections can nest: Example Comment vector [ 1 [ 2 2 ] 3 ] an element can be another vector vector [ 1 { 4 5 } 3 ] an element can be a hashmap hashmap { 1 [ 4 5 ] 2 [ \\a \\b ]} a value in a hashmap can be a vector hashmap { 1 { 4 5 } 2 { \\a \\b }} a value in a hashmap can be a hashmap hashmap {{ 4 5 } 1 [ 1 2 ] 2 } the keys in a hashmap can be a hashmap or vector Hashmaps are often just called maps. Symbols \u00b6 A symbol is a name that is bound to a value. Here, we mean \"bound\" in the sense of \"is tied to\" or \"is associated with\" or \"refers to\". Type Example Comment symbol inc The symbol inc is bound to one of Clojure's builtin functions. This function will return its argument incremented symbol + The symbol + is also bound to a builtin function. It adds its arguments. note: + is not an operator in ClojureScript, it is a function symbol yours Soon you'll see how you can create a symbol and bind it to a value. But that is a few minutes away down the page, so until then, you'll just have to take it on trust that this is possible/easy. That's It For Syntax \u00b6 We've now covered most of Clojure's syntax. But, how can that be? Haven't we only looked at data litterals? Well, yes, but Clojure is Homoiconic which means \"code is data\" - you write Clojure code using Clojure's data litterals and we just covered data litterals. Evaluation \u00b6 You are going to be surprised and delighted with the simplicty of evaluation. 1st Evaluation Rule: all data litterals other than lists and symbols evaluate to themselves. Value Evaluates To Comment \\a \\a Same 1 1 Same [ 1 1 ] [ 1 1 ] Same { 1 1 2 2 } { 1 1 2 2 } Yep, same Below, you can start evaluating live on this page. Enter an expression into the following editor and it will be evaluated. The result of the evaluation will be shown in the box below the editor. XXX inline REPL will go here. In the meantime use this external one Try these experiements: {:a 1 :a 4} -- oops XXX? So, let's talk about the two exceptions lists and symbols ... Evaluating Symbols \u00b6 2nd Evaluation Rule: Symbols don't evaluate to themselves. Instead, they evaluate to the value to which they are \"bound\". Example symbol evaluations: Expression Evaluates To Comments foo 4 Assuming the symbol foo is bound to the value 4 bar [ 1 2 3 ] Assuming the symbol bar is bound to the value [ 1 2 3 ] [ 1 foo ] [ 1 4 ] Each element is evaluated, and foo evaluated to 4 [ foo bar ] [ 4 [ 1 2 3 ]] Assuming foo evaluates to 4 , bar evaluates to [ 1 2 3 ] Symbols are often bound to functions I can tell you that the symbol inc is bound to a function in Clojure's standard library. So, if you evaulate inc , you get the function!! There's another symbol, count , which is bound to different function in the standard library. And, finally - this one will be a surprise - the symbol + is bound to a function. Wait. Isn't + an operator? No. Clojure doesn't have operators. Instead, + is a symbol, and it is bound to a function (which adds). XXX inline REPL will go here. In the meantime use this external one Try these experiements: inc [ inc dec + ] <--- and array of symbols { inc 5 } <--- strange but possible Evaluating Lists \u00b6 3rd Evaluation Rule: a list evaluates to a function call. Oh, now we're cooking with gas! Clojure is a functional language, so you can imagine that function calls are a big deal, so this section is important. Here's an example list ( f arg1 arg2 arg3 ) . Because it is surounded by parens, ( ) , it is a list, and it has four elements. Such a list would be evaluated in two steps : first, each element in the list is evaluated (all four of them in this example) then, a function call occurs where: the evaluation of the 1st element will be the function called the evaluation of the other elements (3 in the case above) will be the actual arguments in this function call The entire list evaluates to the return value of the function call. So, if this example function call returned the string \"maybe Satoshi\" , then the list ( f arg1 arg2 arg3 ) would evaluate to \"maybe Satoshi\" . More on symbols bound to functions In Clojure code, the 1st element of a list is often a symbol. So, let's talk more about that. Here's an example: ( inc 3 ) . That's a two element list, and the first element is the symbol inc . The 2nd element is the value 3 When evaluating this list, in step 1 all elements of the list are evaluated and, if the first element of the list is a symbol, we learned earlier that it will evaluate to what it is bound to. So, if a symbol, like inc , is bound to a function, it is that function which is called in step 2. So inc is a symbol, not a function. But it is bound to a function. A subtle but important distinction. If, instead, inc was bound to the value 27 we couldn't use it in the first position of a list, because it is bound to a number, not a function. We'd get an error at call time. Example list evaluations, involving symbols: List Evaluates To Comments ( inc 3 ) 4 Step 1: evaluate each element of the list (there are two): \u2022 the symbol inc is bound to a builtin function \u2022 and 3 evaluates to 3 Step 2: call the function with 3 as the argument. The return value 4 [ 5 ( inc 6 )] [ 5 7 ] Evaluate each element of the vector. 5 evaluates to 5 . Then, evaluating that 2nd element is a function call. ( + 1 2 ) 3 The symbol + is bound to a builin function. And that function adds together its arguments ( + 1 2 3 ) 6 Surprise! Turns out this function can handle a variable number of arguments. [ 1 ( + 1 2 3 )] [ 1 6 ] No operators We now know that + is a builtin symbol bound to a function, not an operator. It is the same with - , / , > , = , etc. Because these are just names, you can also have not= And because there are no operators, there's no operator precedence to discuss. Simple syntax, right? Let's start evaluating, live. Type into the following editor. Click Ctrl-click to evaluate. Possible experiments: is (+ 1) an error? How about (+) or (*) ? try (odd? 5) try (count [1 2 3]) XXX inline REPL will go here. In the meantime use this external one Not Evaluating \u00b6 We've now reviewed how lists and symbols have special evaluation. But what if we didn't want that? What if we wanted a list to evaluate to itself, like the other data litterals? Answer: you use a leading ' charater on the list . That character means \"don't evaluate as a function call, evaluate as a plain list\". Data Evaluates To Comments ( 1 2 ) Oops. Error! That list will be evaluated as function call, but that 1st element 1 will not evaluate to a function. It is a number. ' ( 1 2 ) ( 1 2 ) No function call happens. That leading quote character says to not evaluate the list as a function call and to instead just let the list evaluate to itself (as most other data literals do). ( count ( 1 2 )) oops error. Can't evaluate ( 1 2 ) because 1 is not a function. ( count ' ( 1 2 )) 2 The list is not evaluated, so count has one list argument. count is builtin function which does what you expect. ' ( inc 1 ) ( inc 1 ) That leading quote character says to not evaluate the list as a function call and let it evaluate to a list with two elements: a symbol and a number. ( list 1 2 ) ( 1 2 ) Also, the builtin function, bound to the symbol list , will make a list from its actual arguments The same applies to symbols, although it is more unusual to see this in production code: Data Evaluates To Comments mine \"something\" Normal evaluation: assumimg that mine is bound to \"something\" 'mine mine A leading ' character means not normal evaluation. Evaluates to the symbol itself, not what it is bound to. Forms \u00b6 A list like this ( + 1 2 ) is known as a form . Forms can nest like this: ( + 1 ( inc 10 )) . So, how do nested forms evaluate? Well, in your mind's eye, see this nested example as ( f arg1 arg2 ) where: f is + arg1 is 1 arg2 is ( inc 10 ) <-- a nested form To evaluate this form, you'll remember from the last section that it is a two step process. First, evaluate each of the three elements. So the execution trace will be: + will evaluate to the builtin function bound to that symbol 1 evaluates to 1 ( inc 10 ) is a list and we evaluate it as a function call: (1) evaluate the elements (2) perform the function call with all three elements evaluated, the function (bound to + ) is called with the two actual arguments of 1 and 11 the return value from the function call is 12 which means the overall evaluation of this nested form is 12 More: Nested Forms Evaluates To Comments ( + 3 ( count [ 1 2 ])) 5 Evaluation trace: \u2022 + is evaluated to a function \u2022 3 is evaluated to 3 \u2022 ( count [ 1 2 ]) is evaluated as a function call which returns 2 \u2022 call function with args 3 and 2 , which returns 5 ( = 2 ( inc 1 )) true = is a symbol which is bound to a builtin function. You can guess what it does. ( = ( inc 1 ) ( dec 3 )) true dec is bound to a bultin, and it decrements its arg by one Evaluate these experiements youself (any surprises?): ( inc ( dec 1 )) ( odd? ( inc ( dec 1 ))) ( = ( inc ( dec 1 )) 1 ) XXX inline REPL will go here. In the meantime use this external one Keywords \u00b6 Keywords are like symbols, excecpt they evaluate to themselves and not to a bound value. This means they evaluate like most other data litterals. Keywords are invaluable as identities and they are used widely, partiuclarly as keys in hashmaps. A keyword is a name that starts with a colon. Let's evaluate some: Value Evaluates To Comments :foo :foo It evaluates to itself. :bar :bar It evaluates to itself ( = :bar :bar ) true Different instances will evaluate to equal. Like numbers do, and strings. ( = :bar :foo ) false [ 1 2 :bar ] [ 1 2 :bar ] Yep, evaluates to itself. { 1 :bar } { 1 :bar } And again, but as a hashmap value Keywords can have a namespace . Value Evaluates To Comments :panel1/edit :panel1/edit Starts with a colon Optionally, contains a / Before the / is the namespace After the / is the name Evaluates to itself :panel2/edit :panel2/edit Different namespace to above, same name :panel.commands/edit :panel.commands/edit namespaces can be dotted ( name :a/b ) \"b\" name is bound to a builtin function ( namespace :a/b ) \"a\" namespace is bound to a builtin function ( keyword \"a/b\" ) :a/b keyword is bound to a builtin function ( keyword \"a\" \"b\" ) :a/b keyword is bound to a builtin function To give you a taste of where this can go, here they are used as the keys in a hashmap: { :user/id 1 :user/name \"Barry\" :user/age 28 :user/company \"SpaceX\" :role/name \"Rocket Sharpener\" } Evaluate these experiements youself (any surprises?): ( namespace :a ) ( keyword ( name :a )) ( keyword ( namespace :a/b ) ( name :a/b )) XXX inline REPL will go here. In the meantime use this external one Kebab Case Please \u00b6 We don't use _ in names. Instead we use - . This applies to both symbols and keywords. That leads to Kebab Casing like this :the-winner-is , and not Snake Casing :dont_do_this . Pascal case is reserved for a situation which we don't cover in this tutorial. We can use - in names because it isn't an operator. In the form ( - 3 2 ) , - is a one character name which is the ultimate in kebab case. It also happens to look like the minus operator in other languages. Predicates \u00b6 On that subject, you'll often see Clojure names which include a trailing ? . For example, even? or nil? . This is a naming convention. It is used for symbols bound to predicate functions which test for a truth. Form Evaluates To ( odd? 5 ) true ( even? 5 ) false ( nil? 5 ) false ( nil? nil ) true ( empty? []) true ( empty? [ :some :thing ]) false Again, we can use ? in names because it is not an operator, as it is in other lanugages. What Have You Learned ? \u00b6 So Far: To write Clojure code, you write Clojure data litteral. You code in data. data can be evaluated, to create new data 1st Evaluation Rule: most data evaluates to itself 2nd Evaluation Rule: symbols evaluate to what they are bound to 3rd Evaluation Rule: lists evaluate to a function call's return value using \"quoting\" we can avoid the 2nd and 3rd evaluation rules. Now, we review some special cases. Special Forms \u00b6 Some Forms are special because they evaluate differently to the \"normal\" rules outlined above. Let's review the important ones. if \u00b6 if forms evaluate in a \"special\" way. This ( if true 4 3 ) is a four element list. Normal evaluation rules would mean, first, evaluate all four elements of the list, and then calling the if function with three arguments. But with if forms, not all elements are evaluated. The 2nd test element is evaluated but then either the 3rd or the 4th argument is evaluated depending on the result of that test . One element remains unevaluated. Example Evaluates To Comments ( if true 4 3 ) 4 Only true and 4 elements are evaluated The 3 element is not evaluated ( if false 4 3 ) 3 Only false and 3 elements are evaluated ( if false 4 ) nil else form not provided for evaluation, so the if evaluates to nil ( if ( odd? 3 ) 3 4 ) 3 ( odd? 3 ) evaluates to true ( = 4 ( inc 3 )) true ( if ( = 4 ( inc 3 )) :t :f ) :t [ 1 ( if true \"yes\" )] [ 1 \"yes\" ] { 1 ( if false \"yes\" )} { 1 nil } No Statements Notice how if is a form in Clojure, which evaluates to a value, and not a statement. (Clojure doesn't have any statements, or operators, it just has data and evaluation rules) Possible experiements: check if (if true) is valid. explore what is \"truthy\", via (if \"hello\" true false) or (if [] true false) or (if nil true false) XXX inline REPL will go here. In the meantime use this external one fn \u00b6 So. now we are taking a bit step up in knowledge. An fn form creates a function. Here is a very simple example ( fn [ x ] x ) : an fn form has three elements: the 2nd is a vector of symbols - in this case [ x ] the 3rd is a body - in this case x an fn form is \"special\" because the 2nd and 3rd elements are not evaluated it is only later, when this function is called, that body will be evaluated, and when that happens, body can refer to symbols in the vector, which will be bound to the actual arguments of the function call our simple example function above only takes one argument. See [ x ] and, when the body is evaluated, at call time, the symbol x will be bound to the actual argument of that function call the function will return the evaluation of the body , which, in the case above, is the same value as the actual argument. consequently, if we called this function with the argument 3 , this function would return 3 and, if we called this function with the argument [ :a :b ] , it would return [ :a :b ] Question : so, how do we call this function? Answer : easy, we already know how, just place it as the first element in a form. Then add a 2nd element in that form, which is the actual argument. Like this: ; Aside: a line which starts with a semi-colon is a comment ; The following is a two element list: ; - the 1st element is a function created by an `fn` form ; - the 2nd element is \"the actual arg\" (( fn [ x ] x ) \"the actual arg\" ) Let's think about what is happening here: This is a list, so it will evaluate to a function call, in the two step process described above First, evaluate all the elements of the list (there are two) The first element (the fn form) will evaluate to a function The second element will evaluate to \"the actual arg\" Second, the function call happens x will be bound to the actual argument \"the actual arg\" the body of the function will be evaluated The body is just x , a symbol which is bound to \"the actual arg\" So the body evaluates to \"the actual arg\" So the function will return \"the actual arg\" And that then is the evaluation of the entire form Here's another call: (( fn [ x ] x ) [ :a :b ]) The actual argument is [ :a :b ] , and the form (function call) will evaluate to [ :a :b ] . Let's create a different function and evaluate it: (( fn [ num ] ( + num 1 )) 4 ) The body of the function, ( + num 1 ) , will be evaluated with the num symbol bound to the actual parameter 4 . The return value is 5 . Try these experiements: (( fn [ x ] [ x x ]) 4 ) or (( fn [ x y ] { x y }) :a 4 ) or (( fn [])) or (( fn [ yes? ] { :a ( if yes? \"yes\" )}) true ) what if, instead, we called this function with false . You won't see this written in normal ClojureScript code, because it is wierd, but here's a puzzle: ((( fn [] inc )) 4 ) What is the evaluation? Note: there is an extra set of parens around the fn form. def \u00b6 The def form creates a symbol and binds it to a value. ( def gurus 2 ) This defines the symbol gurus and binds it to the value 2 . If, later, we used this symbol in other code, it would evaluate to 2 . def is a \"special form\" in two ways: when evaluated, it adds to the global set of defined symbols. Such mutation is known as a side-effect. Functions don't normally cause side effect - they are normally pure. in a normal Clojure form, like say ( f gurus 2 ) , the gurus element would be evaluated before the call. But the evaluation rules in a def form are different because, instead, gurus is the symbol to define. It doesn't get evaluated. But the 3rd element certainly does. The 3rd element of a def is evaluated: ( def saints ( inc gurus )) ;; look, using the symbol `gurus` !! saints is now also a defined symbol and it is bound to the evaluation of ( inc gurus ) , which is ( inc 2 ) , which is 3 . Consider these two: ( def beach-list [ :hat :sunglasses :towel ]) ( def beach-items ( count beach-list )) ;; count is a builtin function beach-items is a symbol bound to 3 Now, consider what is happening here: ( def my-inc ( fn [ a ] ( + a 1 )) That fn form will create a function, and then the def will bind it to the symbol my-inc . Two steps. Hey, we've just created our own inc . ( my-inc 4 ) evaluates to 5 And again: ( def square-it ( fn [ x ] ( * x x ))) We can use this symbol square-it in a form (it is now bound to a function), like this: ( square-it 5 ) evaluates to 25 defn \u00b6 A ClojureScript program typically contains a lot of function definitions, and combining def and fn each time would be verbose. So, there is a shorter way which combines the two, called defn . You use it like this: ( defn dec ; `dec` is the symbol being defined [ n ] ; a vector of symbols for the actual arguments ( - n 1 )) ; function body - evaluated when function is called - uses `n` So, this binds a symbol to a function. All of the \"builtin functions\" mentioned previously in this tutorial are defined this way: str , count , inc , namespace , + etc. To use the symbol/function just defined: ( dec 4 ) evaluates to 3 Define another function: ( defn square-it ; `square-it` is the symbol being defined [ n ] ; a vector of symbols for the actual arguments ( * n n )) ; function body - evaluated when function is called - uses `n` use it: ( square-it 3 ) evaluates to 9 . Or use it like this: ( square-it ( inc 3 )) evaluates to 16 . Define another: ( defn greet [ username ] ( str \"Hello \" username ))) str is a builtin function which turns each of its arguments into a string and concatenates them. use it: ( greet \"world\" ) evaluates to \"Hello world\" . In a functional language, creating functions is a big deal. You'll be using defn a lot. let \u00b6 This is another special form you'll be using a lot . ; a let form has two parts: ; - 1st a vector of \"binding pairs\" ; - 2nd a \"body\" ( let [ a \"pen\" ] ; a pair - binds the symbol `a` to the value \"pen\" a ) ; the body is evaluated with the bindings This let form evaluates to \"pen\" Another one: ( let [ a \"pen\" ] :foo ) ; odd. The body doesn't use `a`. But this still works. This let form evaluates to :foo Notice the way this let form is formatted: ( let [ a \"pen\" ; this pair means `a` is bound to \"pen\" b \"sword\" ] ; this pair means `b` is bound to \"sword\" ( > a b )) ; is \"pen\" greater than \"sword\" ?? evaluates to false . Wait, no. That isn't convential wisdom. Damn you lexographic comparisons!! We need to make some changes: ( let [ a \"the pen\" b \"a sword\" ] ( if ( > a b ) a b )) evaluates to \"a pen\" . Phew! ( let [ a \"the pen\" b \"a sword\" ] { :winner-is ( if ( > a b ) a b )}) evaluates to { :winner-is \"the pen\" } let is often used within a defn : ( defn items-text [ items ] ( let [ num ( count items ) plural ( if ( = num 1 ) \"\" \"s\" ) verb ( if ( > num 1 ) \"are \" \"is \" )] ( str \"There \" verb num \" item\" plural ))) Check on the output in these cases: ( items-text [ :towel :sunglasses ]) ( items-text [ :towel ]) ( items-text []) Exercise: when there are no items make the text \"there are no items\" (and not \"there is 0 items\") What have You Learned ? \u00b6 So Far: the syntax is just data litterals data can be evaluated lists (forms) evaluate to function calls there are special forms (exceptions to the normal evaluation rules for forms) defn allows us to bind a function to a symbol Data Functions \u00b6 Sometimes data can act as a function - it can appear as the first element in a form. For example, a hashmap can act as a function. This is easiest to explain via code: ({ :a 11 } :a ) Here, a hashmap { :a 11 } is used as the 1st element in a form . The actual argument, :a , will be looked up in that hashmap, and the associated value, 11 , is the return value of the function call. So 11 is the evaluation. ({ :a 11 :b 21 } :b ) evaluates to 21 . We are looking up the key :b in the hashmap { :a 11 :b 21 } and obtaining the associated value 21 ({ :a 11 :b 21 } :c ) evaluates to nil . There's no key :c in the hashmap. ({ :a 11 :b 21 } :c :not-found ) evaluates to :not-found . The key was not found in the hashmap, but we supplied a default value as the 2nd actual argument (the 3rd element of the list). This can be reversed. A keyword can also be used as the 1st element in a form, provided the actual argument is a hashmap. ( :a { :a 11 }) evaluates to 11 ( :b { :a 11 :b 21 }) evaluates to 21 ( :c { :a 11 :b 21 }) evaluates to nil ( :c { :a 11 :b 21 } :not-found ) evaluates to :not-found This approach of using a keyword as the function, with a hashmap argument happens a lot in ClojureScript Code. BuiltIn Functions \u00b6 Clojure's has a substantial library of builtin functions. A few in particular are used all the time, and to read Clojure code (our aim here), you must know them. assoc \u00b6 assoc allows you to add a key/value pair to a hashmap. Example Evaluates To Comments ( assoc {} :a 4 ) { :a 4 } adding a key/value pair to the empty hashmap {} ( assoc nil :a 4 ) { :a 4 } nil is treated as {} ( assoc { :b 1 } :a 4 ) { :b 1 :a 4 } adding a key/value pair to the hashmap { :b 1 } ( assoc {} :b 1 :a 4 ) { :b 1 :a 4 } add two pairs at once map \u00b6 Applies a function to all the elements of a collection. First, we create a function called plus-one ( defn plus-one [ it ] ( + 1 it )) Now use it with map : Example of map Evaluates To Comments ( map plus-one [ 1 2 3 ]) ( 2 3 4 ) Applies plus-one to each element of the collection. Think [( plus-one 1 ) ( plus-one 2 ) ( plus-one 3 )] except the result is a list, not a vector. ( map inc [ 1 2 3 ]) ( 2 3 4 ) Same as above, but now inc ( map inc ' ( 1 2 3 )) ( 2 3 4 ) Same as above. But now across a list . Note the use of quote on the list ( map inc # { 1 2 3 }) ( 2 3 4 ) Same as above. But now across a set . ( map count [ \"hi\" \"world\" ]) ( 2 5 ) Think ( count \"hi\" ) ( count \"world\" ) ( map :a [{ :a 1 } { :a 11 }]) ( 1 11 ) Earlier, we learned that keywords can act like functions. Think ( :a { :a 1 }) ( :a { :a 11 }) Note: map always returns a list , even if you give it a vector, set, list, etc. Create add for use with map below: ( defn add [ a b ] ( + a b )) Example Evaluates To Comments ( map add [ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ]) ( 5 7 9 ) Applies add to pairs of elements. Think [( add 1 4 ) ( add 2 5 ) ( add 3 6 )] , except result is a list ( map + [ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ]) ( 5 7 9 ) Same as above. But using the builtin function + Exercises: ( map { :a 1 :b 2 :c 3 } [ :a :b :c :d ]) What would this evaluate to: ( map count ( map str ( map inc [ 9 99 999 ]))) XXX Live coding here. reduce \u00b6 In the functional world, reduce is part 600 pound gorilla, part swiss arm knife. It takes three arguments: a function which \"accumulates\" the initial state of the accumulation a collection to accumulate \"across\" ( reduce + ;; accumulating with `+` 0 ;; initial state of accumulation [ 1 2 4 ]) ;; the collection to accumulate across, element by element The accumulation function, + in the example above, must accept two arguments: the current, running accumulation, up to the current element the new element to process The accumulation function should combine the current, running accumulation, with the new element, and return an updated accumulation. + works because it can take two arguments and it will return a new accumulation of the two. Because there are three elements in our example collection [ 1 2 4 ] , there are three steps in the reduction. If our collection had 100 elements, there would be 100 steps in the reduction. This is effectively what reduce will compute for the example above: ( + ( + ( + 0 1 ) 2 ) 4 ) evaluates to 7 and, in this case reduce , is effectively summing the collection Or, to explain the three steps another way: Collection Element Running Accumulation Evaluation using + New Accumulation Comment 1 0 ( + 0 1 ) 1 + is applied to the initial value 0 and the 1st element of the collection 1 , producing a new accumulation of 1 2 1 ( + 1 2 ) 3 + is applied to the accumulation 1 and the 2nd element of the collection 2 , producing a new accumulation of 3 4 3 ( + 3 4 ) 7 + is applied to the accumulation 3 and the 3rd element of the collection 4 , producing a new accumulation of 7 Next example: we create this accumulation function: ( defn max [ a b ] ( if ( > a b ) a b )) Then we use that function with a reduce: ( reduce max ;; accumulating with `max` 0 ;; initial accumulation (maximum) [ 1 2 4 ]) ;; the collection to process Effectively, what gets evaluated: ( max ( max ( max 0 1 ) 2 ) 4 ) How about this one: ( reduce str ;; accumulating with the builtin `str` 0 [ 1 2 4 ]) We \"accumulate\" a string How about this one: ( reduce conj ;; <--- `conj` is a builtin too [] ;; <--- empty vector [ 1 2 4 ]) Or this one: ( defn only-odd [ accumulation val ] ;; <-- accumulated value, new value ( if ( even? val ) accumulation ( conj accumulation val ))) ( reduce only-odd [] ;; <--- start with an empty vector [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) The Arrow Macros \u00b6 Clojure has an advanced feature called macros which we'll review now, because you need to understand their impact. Macros are functions which are run at compile time, not run time. Their job is to rewrite your code in useful ways. This is probably not a feature you'll have experienced before in other languages. Wait, rewrite my code? How is that even possible? Well, in ClojureScript your code is data . It is just arrangements of data litterals put into text file, involving mostly lists, symbols and vectors. This property means a function can take your code (which is just data, remember), and compute new data, which is new code. And that is how a macro rewrites your code - it is a function that runs at compile time. The key takeway is that macros rewrite your code in useful ways. Thread First Macro -> \u00b6 Let's talk examples ... here's a deeply nested arrangement of forms we talked about earlier: ( + ( + ( + 0 1 ) 2 ) 4 ) Deeply nested forms, like this, are often rewritten using the thread first macro -> : ( -> ( + 0 1 ) ; (+ 0 1) ( + 2 ) ; (+ (+ 0 1) 2) ( + 4 ))) ; (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 4) -> is a symbol and it is the first element in a form ( -> ... ) . So, this is a function call and the symbol -> is bound to the function to be called, a bit like ( + ... ) . And, in this example, the function call has three actual arguments - I can see three forms. But this -> function is actually getting called at compile time, not run time. And this thread first function (marco) will rewrite/reorganise the three forms provided as arguments, producing new code. And that new code will match exactly the deeply-nested-forms version given above. Read the thread first version (above) like this: First, ( max 0 1 ) is evaluated to 1 Then that 1 value becomes the 1st argument to the next form down, which is ( + 2 ) , effectively creating ( + 1 2 ) Then the evaluation of that form becomes the first argument to the next form, which is ( + 4 ) , effectively creating ( + 3 4 ) The result is 7 Notice how the value for the previous form's evaluation is always \"threaded\" into the form below as the 1st argument. Hence the name \"thread first\". Deeply nested forms can be a bit hard to read, so the thread first macro arrangement allows you to visulaise the computation as a cascading data flow. It is as if the evaluation of the higher form is \"flowing down\" and into the form underneath. That's the mental model, and most find it useful. How about this use of -> : ( -> {} ( assoc :a 1 ) ; (assoc {} :a 1) ( assoc :b 2 )) ; (assoc (assoc {} :a 1) :b 2) Read that as: First, {} is evaluated to {} Then that value becomes the 1st argument to the next form down creating ( assoc {} :a 1 ) And the evaluation of that form becomes the first argument to the next form creating ( assoc { :a 1 } :b 2 ) The entire form evaluates to { :a 1 :b 2 } Now, we could choose to simply write it the deeply nested way ourselves, of course, but humans seem to better understand the \"data flow\" version more than the nested forms version. Work out the evaluation of: ( -> { :a { :aa 11 }} :a ;; same as (:a) :aa ) ;; same as (:aa) -> belongs to a small family of marcos. Another one is the thread last macro ->> . It operates the same way except it threads the value as the argument in the last position, not the first. Thread Last Macro ->> \u00b6 Do you remember this nested form example from earlier: ( map count ( map str ( map inc [ 9 99 999 ]))) This can be rewritten using the \"thread last\" macro ->> : ( ->> [ 9 99 999 ] ( map inc ) ; (map inc [9 99 999]) ( map str ) ; (map str (map inc [9 99 999])) ( map count )) ; (map count (map str (map inc [9 99 999]))) With thread last the evaluation of the previous previous form is threaded into the next form as the last argument (not the first). Work out the evaluation of: ( ->> ( range 10 ) ; (range 10) ( map inc ) ; (map inc (range 10)) ( filter odd? )) ; (filter odd? (map inc (range 10)) The Hard Bit \u00b6 The learning curve has been gentle. Clojure has simple syntax and simple evaluation semantics. The steeper part of the Clojure learning curve is when you have to write code using pure functions and immutable data . If you have previously only used imperative, place-oriented languages (eg. OO laguages), this is the paradigm change which takes time to click. But, of course, the purpose of this tutorial is to teach you to read Clojure, which is an easier skill. So, onward ... Immutable Data \u00b6 ClojureScript uses immtutable data structures by default. The rule : once you create data, you can't mutate it (change it). Ever. But you can create a revision (a copy) of that data, which is modified in some way. The original data is untouched. But, then, you can't change this revision either. But, you can create a further revision (copy) of the revision, etc. Let's see this in action. Evaluate the following: ( let [ car1 { :doors 2 } ; an original hashmap car2 ( assoc car1 :seats 4 ) ; add a key/value pair, a new revision is created car3 ( assoc car2 :engine :big )] ; add a key/value pair, a new revision is created [ car1 car2 car3 ]) ; the value associated with car1 is untouched you'll see a vector of three values [{ :doors 2 } { :doors 2 , :seats 4 } { :doors 2 , :seats 4 , :engine :big } ] . Notice how car1 is unchanged, even though we did an assoc into car1 . Same with XXXXXXXXX When you are used to imperative, in-place modification of data, it can initially be mysterfying as to how you can achieve anything. Rest assured, you can. More experiements. If we evaluate this: ( assoc ( assoc score :c 3 ) :d 4 ) there will be three revisions of a hashmap. The original one bound to score which is { :a 1 :b 2 } . Then there's the one which results from ( assoc score :c 3 ) . And then there is the final one { :a 1 :b 2 :c 3 :d 4 } . If you are new to Immutable Data, you probably have two concerns: Surely this is inefficient? Don't worry, via clever algorithms, efficiency is seldom an issue. How do you get anything done? (Don't worry, there are answers here too). Using Immutable data dovetails with pure functions, to reduce cognative load and bring a great simplicity to your programming. All grand claims. We'll need to see how this plays out in bigger programs. Evaluate the following: ( let [ car1 { :doors 2 } ;; original hashmap car2 ( assoc car1 :doors 4 ) ;; new value for :doors car3 ( assoc car2 :doors 2 )] ;; back to the original value of 2 [( = car1 car3 ) ( identical? car1 car3 )]) ;; identical? tests if two pieces of data at the same piece Evaluate the following: ( let [ car1 { :doors 2 } ;; this hashmap can't be changed car2 ( assoc car1 :doors 2 )] ;; wait on, same values!!! ( identical? car1 car2 )) ;; identical? tests if two pieces of data at the same XXX boolean and and or ??? https://j19sch.github.io/blog/clj3-and-or-being-weird/ XXX destructuring ??

Alan Kay once descibed LISP as \"Maxwell's equations of software\". Paul Graham says LISP was a competitive advantage for his startup. Dijkstra has written glowingly of it. For 50 years, some of the finest minds in software have admired it, used it and refined it. In the years leading up to 2010, Rich Hickey created Clojure, introducing a number of key inovations (later adopted by other functional languages), and he did it well away from acedemia, because he wanted to create a pragmatic language for commercial developers. Overall, Clojure is a foliated masterpiece. As the owner of a company which develops software products, I believe ClojureScript gives us a competitive edge. As a programmer, I feel like it has provided me with excellent, nourishing brain food. It is a stable, productive place, with little churn. In contrast, when I look across to the Javascript landscape, it appears like a churning washing machine with not much new or interesting to teach me. Learning a LISP will likely make you better developer for life, even if you aren't using LISP. Clojure runs on the JVM. ClojureScript runs in the browser.

Oh, now we're cooking with gas! Clojure is a functional language, so you can imagine that function calls are a big deal, so this section is important. Here's an example list ( f arg1 arg2 arg3 ) . Because it is surounded by parens, ( ) , it is a list, and it has four elements. Such a list would be evaluated in two steps : first, each element in the list is evaluated (all four of them in this example) then, a function call occurs where: the evaluation of the 1st element will be the function called the evaluation of the other elements (3 in the case above) will be the actual arguments in this function call The entire list evaluates to the return value of the function call. So, if this example function call returned the string \"maybe Satoshi\" , then the list ( f arg1 arg2 arg3 ) would evaluate to \"maybe Satoshi\" . More on symbols bound to functions In Clojure code, the 1st element of a list is often a symbol. So, let's talk more about that. Here's an example: ( inc 3 ) . That's a two element list, and the first element is the symbol inc . The 2nd element is the value 3 When evaluating this list, in step 1 all elements of the list are evaluated and, if the first element of the list is a symbol, we learned earlier that it will evaluate to what it is bound to. So, if a symbol, like inc , is bound to a function, it is that function which is called in step 2. So inc is a symbol, not a function. But it is bound to a function. A subtle but important distinction. If, instead, inc was bound to the value 27 we couldn't use it in the first position of a list, because it is bound to a number, not a function. We'd get an error at call time. Example list evaluations, involving symbols: List Evaluates To Comments ( inc 3 ) 4 Step 1: evaluate each element of the list (there are two): \u2022 the symbol inc is bound to a builtin function \u2022 and 3 evaluates to 3 Step 2: call the function with 3 as the argument. The return value 4 [ 5 ( inc 6 )] [ 5 7 ] Evaluate each element of the vector. 5 evaluates to 5 . Then, evaluating that 2nd element is a function call. ( + 1 2 ) 3 The symbol + is bound to a builin function. And that function adds together its arguments ( + 1 2 3 ) 6 Surprise! Turns out this function can handle a variable number of arguments. [ 1 ( + 1 2 3 )] [ 1 6 ] No operators We now know that + is a builtin symbol bound to a function, not an operator. It is the same with - , / , > , = , etc. Because these are just names, you can also have not= And because there are no operators, there's no operator precedence to discuss. Simple syntax, right?

Here is a very simple example ( fn [ x ] x ) : an fn form has three elements: the 2nd is a vector of symbols - in this case [ x ] the 3rd is a body - in this case x an fn form is \"special\" because the 2nd and 3rd elements are not evaluated it is only later, when this function is called, that body will be evaluated, and when that happens, body can refer to symbols in the vector, which will be bound to the actual arguments of the function call our simple example function above only takes one argument. See [ x ] and, when the body is evaluated, at call time, the symbol x will be bound to the actual argument of that function call the function will return the evaluation of the body , which, in the case above, is the same value as the actual argument. consequently, if we called this function with the argument 3 , this function would return 3 and, if we called this function with the argument [ :a :b ] , it would return [ :a :b ] Question : so, how do we call this function? Answer : easy, we already know how, just place it as the first element in a form. Then add a 2nd element in that form, which is the actual argument. Like this: ; Aside: a line which starts with a semi-colon is a comment ; The following is a two element list: ; - the 1st element is a function created by an `fn` form ; - the 2nd element is \"the actual arg\" (( fn [ x ] x ) \"the actual arg\" ) Let's think about what is happening here: This is a list, so it will evaluate to a function call, in the two step process described above First, evaluate all the elements of the list (there are two) The first element (the fn form) will evaluate to a function The second element will evaluate to \"the actual arg\" Second, the function call happens x will be bound to the actual argument \"the actual arg\" the body of the function will be evaluated The body is just x , a symbol which is bound to \"the actual arg\" So the body evaluates to \"the actual arg\" So the function will return \"the actual arg\" And that then is the evaluation of the entire form Here's another call: (( fn [ x ] x ) [ :a :b ]) The actual argument is [ :a :b ] , and the form (function call) will evaluate to [ :a :b ] .

Macros are functions which are run at compile time, not run time. Their job is to rewrite your code in useful ways. This is probably not a feature you'll have experienced before in other languages. Wait, rewrite my code? How is that even possible? Well, in ClojureScript your code is data . It is just arrangements of data litterals put into text file, involving mostly lists, symbols and vectors. This property means a function can take your code (which is just data, remember), and compute new data, which is new code. And that is how a macro rewrites your code - it is a function that runs at compile time. The key takeway is that macros rewrite your code in useful ways.","title":"The Arrow Macros"},{"location":"clojurescript/#thread-first-macro-","text":"Let's talk examples ... here's a deeply nested arrangement of forms we talked about earlier: ( + ( + ( + 0 1 ) 2 ) 4 ) Deeply nested forms, like this, are often rewritten using the thread first macro -> : ( -> ( + 0 1 ) ; (+ 0 1) ( + 2 ) ; (+ (+ 0 1) 2) ( + 4 ))) ; (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 4) -> is a symbol and it is the first element in a form ( -> ... ) . So, this is a function call and the symbol -> is bound to the function to be called, a bit like ( + ... ) . And, in this example, the function call has three actual arguments - I can see three forms. But this -> function is actually getting called at compile time, not run time. And this thread first function (marco) will rewrite/reorganise the three forms provided as arguments, producing new code. And that new code will match exactly the deeply-nested-forms version given above. Read the thread first version (above) like this: First, ( max 0 1 ) is evaluated to 1 Then that 1 value becomes the 1st argument to the next form down, which is ( + 2 ) , effectively creating ( + 1 2 ) Then the evaluation of that form becomes the first argument to the next form, which is ( + 4 ) , effectively creating ( + 3 4 ) The result is 7 Notice how the value for the previous form's evaluation is always \"threaded\" into the form below as the 1st argument. Hence the name \"thread first\". Deeply nested forms can be a bit hard to read, so the thread first macro arrangement allows you to visulaise the computation as a cascading data flow. It is as if the evaluation of the higher form is \"flowing down\" and into the form underneath. That's the mental model, and most find it useful. How about this use of -> : ( -> {} ( assoc :a 1 ) ; (assoc {} :a 1) ( assoc :b 2 )) ; (assoc (assoc {} :a 1) :b 2) Read that as: First, {} is evaluated to {} Then that value becomes the 1st argument to the next form down creating ( assoc {} :a 1 ) And the evaluation of that form becomes the first argument to the next form creating ( assoc { :a 1 } :b 2 ) The entire form evaluates to { :a 1 :b 2 } Now, we could choose to simply write it the deeply nested way ourselves, of course, but humans seem to better understand the \"data flow\" version more than the nested forms version. Work out the evaluation of: ( -> { :a { :aa 11 }} :a ;; same as (:a) :aa ) ;; same as (:aa) -> belongs to a small family of marcos. Another one is the thread last macro ->> .

But, then, you can't change this revision either. But, you can create a further revision (copy) of the revision, etc. Let's see this in action. Evaluate the following: ( let [ car1 { :doors 2 } ; an original hashmap car2 ( assoc car1 :seats 4 ) ; add a key/value pair, a new revision is created car3 ( assoc car2 :engine :big )] ; add a key/value pair, a new revision is created [ car1 car2 car3 ]) ; the value associated with car1 is untouched you'll see a vector of three values [{ :doors 2 } { :doors 2 , :seats 4 } { :doors 2 , :seats 4 , :engine :big } ] .

It breaks a rule. re-frame Rule Views should only compute hiccup. A view shouldn't process input data. The subscriptions it uses should deliver the data already in the right structure, ready for use in hiccup generation. The \"simple\" app contained this code: ( defn clock [] ( let [ colour @ ( rf/subscribe [ :time-color ]) time ( -> @ ( rf/subscribe [ :time ]) .toTimeString ( clojure.string/split \" \" ) first )] [ :div.example-clock { :style { :color colour }} time ])) That view obtains data from a [:time] subscription and then it further processes that data into the form it needs for use in the hiccup. We don't like that. The Solution \u00b6 We're going to rewrite this slightly. We will create a new [:time-str] subscription which will deliver the right data to the view, ready to go, so the view is 100% concerned with hiccup generation only. Maybe, like this: ( defn clock [] [ :div.example-clock { :style { :color @ ( rf/subscribe [ :time-color ])}} @ ( rf/subscribe [ :time-str ])]) So, we'll add this time-str subscription handler: ( reg-sub :time-str ;; signals function ( fn [ _ _ ] ( subscribe [ :time ])) ;; computation function ( fn [ t _ ] ( -> t .toTimeString ( clojure.string/split \" \" ) first ))) Now the subscription does the computation, not the view. Much better. You'll notice this new subscription handler belongs to \"Layer 3\" of the Signal Graph . We could rewrite it to use the :<- syntactic sugar: ( reg-sub :time-str :<- [ :time ] ;; <-- this is syntactic sugar for signals function ( fn [ t _ ] ( -> t .toTimeString ( clojure.string/split \" \" ) first ))) Another Technique Above, I suggested this: ( defn clock [] [ :div.example-clock { :style { :color @ ( rf/subscribe [ :time-color ])}} @ ( rf/subscribe [ :time-str ])]) But that may offend your finely tuned aesthetics. Too much noise with those two @ ? To clean this up, we could define a new listen function: ( defn listen [ query-v ] @ ( rf/subscribe query-v )) And then rewrite: ( defn clock [] [ :div.example-clock { :style { :color ( listen [ :time-color ])}} ( listen [ :time-str ])]) So, at the cost of writing your own function, listen , the code is now less noisy AND there's less chance of us forgetting an @ (which can lead to odd problems). listen would obviously be useful in every View, not just this one. LambdaIsland Naming (LIN) \u00b6 I ended up quite liking the alternative names suggested by Lambda Island Videos : ( def <sub ( comp deref re-frame.core/subscribe )) ;; same as `listen` (above) ( def >evt re-frame.core/dispatch ) Say It Again \u00b6 So, using your new-found knowledge, if, in code review, you saw this view function: ( defn show-items [] ( let [ sorted-items ( sort @ ( subscribe [ :items ]))] ( into [ :div ] ( for [ i sorted-items ] [ item-view i ])))) What would you leap on with a banshee scream supportively object to? That sort , right? Computation in the view. Instead, we want exactly the right data delivered to the view - no further computation required - the view's job is to simply make hiccup . The solution is to create a subscription that delivers items already sorted. ( reg-sub :sorted-items ( fn [ _ _ ] ( subscribe [ :items ])) ( fn [ items _ ] ( sort items )) Now, in this case the computation is a bit trivial, but the moment it is a little tricky, you'll want to test it. So separating it out from the view will make that easier. To make it testable, you may structure like this: ( defn item-sorter [ items _ ] ( sort items )) ( reg-sub :sorted-items ( fn [ _ _ ] ( subscribe [ :items ])) item-sorter ) Now it is easy to test item-sorter independently. The Other Benefit \u00b6 re-frame de-duplicates signal graph nodes. If, for example, two views wanted to (subscribe [:sorted-items]) only the one node (in the signal graph) would be created. Only one node would be doing that potentially expensive sorting operation (when items changed) and values from it would be flowing through to both views. That sort of efficiency can't happen if the views themselves are doing the sort . de-duplication \u00b6 As I described above, two, or more, concurrent subscriptions for the same query will source reactive updates from the one executing handler - from the one node in the signal graph. How do we know if two subscriptions are \"the same\"? Answer: two subscriptions are the same if their query vectors test = to each other. So, these two subscriptions are not \"the same\": [:some-event 42] [:some-event \"blah\"] . Even though they involve the same event id, :some-event , the query vectors do not test = . This feature shakes out well because re-frame has a data oriented design. A Final FAQ \u00b6 The following issue comes up a bit. You will end up with a bunch of Layer 2 reg-sub which look the same (they directly extract a path within app-db ): ( reg-sub :a ( fn [ db _ ] ( :a db ))) ( reg-sub :b ( fn [ db _ ] ( -> db :top :b ))) Now, you think and design abstractly for a living, and that repetition will feel uncomfortable. It will call to you like a Siren: \"refaaaaactoooor meeeee\". \"Maaaake it DRYYYY\". So here's my tip: tie yourself to the mast and sail on. That repetition is good. It is serving a purpose. Just sail on. The WORST thing you can do is to flex your magnificent abstraction muscles and create something like this: ( reg-sub :extract-any-path ( fn [ db path ] ( get-in db path )) \"Genius!\", you think to yourself. \"Now I only need one direct reg-sub and I supply a path to it. A read-only cursor of sorts. Look at the code I can delete.\" Neat and minimal it most certainly is, yes, but genius it isn't, IMHO. You are now asking the code USING the subscription to provide the path. You have traded some innocuous repetition for longer term fragility, and that's not a good trade. What fragility? Well, the view which subscribes using, say, (subscribe [:extract-any-path [:some :path]]) now \"knows\" about (depends on) the structure within app-db . What happens when you inevitably restructure app-db and put that :path path under another high level branch of app-db ? You will have to run around all the views, looking for the paths supplied, knowing which to alter and which to leave alone. Fragile.

As you create a re-frame app, you design just the right set of them. These events will model \"intent\" - generally the user's.

Imagine we created a drawing application - something simple that allowed a user to draw circles and triangles and add some text.

Data which happens to be \"executable\" by the right machine - an x86 machine in this case. I'd like you to now look back at that collection of events and view it in the same way - data instructions which can be executed - by the right machine. Wait. What machine? A virtual machine. All the Event Handlers you register collectively implement the \"virtual machine\" on which these instructions execute. When you register a new event handler using reg-event-db , it is as if you are adding to the \"instruction set\" of this \"machine\". When introducing re-frame, I said it had Data-Oriented Design. Typically, that claim means you \"program in a data\". You assemble data in a particular format (a domain-specific language), and that data is then \"executed\" by an interpreter. Consider hiccup. It is a domain-specific language (DSL) for describing DOM. You make a data structure in the right format and Reagent acts as the \"interpreter\" which executes that \"language\". We can use pure data literals: [ :div { :font-size 12 } \"Hello\" ] ;; a data structure containing instructions Or we can add a small bit of computation: [ :div ( when friendly? \"Hello\" \"Go away\" ) \" world\" ] Or, a lot more computation: ( into [ :div ] ( map display-item items )] However the hiccup-formatted data is assembled, it acts as \"instructions\" for Reagent. Back to re-frame. It asks that you create a DSL for your app - events are your DSL. (I wasn't kidding when I said events are the \"language of your system\".) And it asks that you provide a way to execute the instructions in that DSL. When your re-frame application runs, it is executing a \"program\" - a collection of events - dynamically created by the user's actions - on a virtual machine made from the handlers you register. Events are the (assembly) language of your application. Hiccup is the DOM of your application, etc. And it is all data. Look carefully into re-frame and you'll see the primacy of data everywhere.

Data which happens to be \"executable\" by the right machine - an x86 machine in this case. I'd like you to now look back at that collection of events and view it in the same way - data instructions which can be executed - by the right machine. Wait. What machine? A virtual machine. All the Event Handlers you register collectively implement the \"virtual machine\" on which these instructions execute. When you register a new event handler using reg-event-db , it is as if you are adding to the \"instruction set\" of this \"machine\". When introducing re-frame, I said it had Data-Oriented Design. Typically, that claim means you \"program in a data\". You assemble data in a particular format (a domain-specific language), and that data is then \"executed\" by an interpreter. Consider hiccup. It is a domain-specific language (DSL) for describing DOM. You make a data structure in the right format and Reagent acts as the \"interpreter\" which executes that \"language\". We can use pure data literals: [ :div { :font-size 12 } \"Hello\" ] ;; a data structure containing instructions Or we can add a small bit of computation: [ :div ( when friendly? \"Hello\" \"Go away\" ) \" world\" ] Or, a lot more computation: ( into [ :div ] ( map display-item items )] However the hiccup-formatted data is assembled, it acts as \"instructions\" for Reagent. Back to re-frame. It asks that you create a DSL for your app - events are your DSL. (I wasn't kidding when I said events are the \"language of your system\".) And it asks that you provide a way to execute the instructions in that DSL. When your re-frame application runs, it is executing a \"program\" - a collection of events - dynamically created by the user's actions - on a virtual machine made from the handlers you register. Events are the (assembly) language of your application. Hiccup is the DOM of your application, etc. And it is all data. Look carefully into re-frame and you'll see the primacy of data everywhere. Data is the ultimate in late binding.

We will now shift down to 30,000 feet and look in more detail, this time with code fragments. The Setup \u00b6 Imagine this: our app displays a list of items. The user clicks the \"delete\" button next to the 3rd item in the list. In response, let's track what happens within our imaginary re-frame app? Let's manually step through the resulting six domino cascade. Don't expect to completely grok the terse code presented below. We're still at 30,000 feet. More details later. Domino 1 \u00b6 In order for it to be clicked, that 3rd delete button must have already been rendered. And rendering in re-frame is done by a ViewFunction . Perhaps it was rendered like this: ( defn delete-button [ item-id ] [ :div.garbage-bin :on-click # ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :delete-item item-id ])]) It is that on-click handler (function) which interests us. When the user clicks on the garbage-bin icon, that function is called. # ( re-frame.core/dispatch [ :delete-item item-id ]) This function calls re-frame's dispatch to emit an event . Every re-frame event is a vector and, in this case, the dispatched event has two elements: [ :delete-item 2486 ] where 2486 is an id I just made up for that 3rd item. The first element of an event vector, :delete-item , is the kind of event. The rest is optional data, salient to the event . Events express user intent in a domain-specific way. They are the language of your re-frame system. Domino 2 \u00b6 An event handler (function), which we'll name h , is now called to compute the effect of the event [:delete-item 2486] . On startup, re-frame apps register handlers for events using reg-event-fx . So, in our imaginary app, because h is the handler function for :delete-item events, it must have been registered like this: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx ;; a part of the re-frame API :delete-item ;; the kind of event h ) ;; the handler function for this kind of event Because h is an event handler, it is written to take two arguments: a coeffects map. This data describes the current state of \"the world\". In the simplest case, it is a trivial map like this: {:db a-value} where a-value is the current application state held in app-db . the event to handle, which would be [:delete-item 2486] in this case. h will compute effects as data. That means: it computes how the world should be changed by the event, and it returns a map of effects which describe the necessary changes. Here's a sketch (we are at 30,000 feet): ( defn h ;; maybe choose a better name like `delete-item` [ coeffects event ] ;; `coeffects` holds the current state of the world ( let [ item-id ( second event ) ;; extract id from event vector state ( :db coeffects ) ;; extract the current application state new-state ( dissoc-in db [ :items item-id ])] ;; new app state { :db new-state })) ;; a map of the necessary effects There are ways (described in later tutorials) for you to inject necessary aspects of \"the world\" into that first coeffects argument (map). Different event handlers need to know different \"things\" about the world to do their job. But current \"application state\" is one aspect of the world which is invariably needed, and it is available by default in the :db key. So the current value in app-db is available via the expression (:db coeffects) . The value returned by h is a map with only one key, like this: { :db updated-value-to-put-into-app-db } So, h computes one effect - which is a change to application state. Please pay particular attention to this overall flow, within h : h obtains the current application state (a map) via (:db coeffects) it computes a modified application state via (dissoc-in db [:items item-id]) it returns this modified application state in an effect map {:db new-state} BTW, here is a more idiomatic (and terser) rewrite of h which uses destructuring of the args: ( defn h [{ :keys [ db ]} [ _ item-id ]] ;; <--- new: obtain db and item-id directly { :db ( dissoc-in db [ :items item-id ])}) ;; Domino 3 \u00b6 effect handler functions action the effects returned by h . In Domino 2, h returned: { :db updated-value-to-put-in-app-db } Each key of this returned map identifies one kind of effect , and the value for that key supplies further details. The map returned by h only has one key, :db , so it is specifying only one effect. On startup, a re-frame app can register effects handlers using reg-fx . For example, the effect handler function for the :db effect could be registered like this: ( re-frame.core/reg-fx ;; part of the re-frame API :db ;; the effects key ( fn [ val ] ;; the handler function for the effect ( reset! app-db val ))) ;; put the new value into the ratom app-db Just to be clear, this reset! of app-db is a mutative, effectful action. That's what effect handlers do. They change the world. They are not pure functions. Now, you don't actually need to ever register an effects handler for :db because re-frame supplies one built in. re-frame manages app-db and so it will look after changes to it. But if, instead, h had returned: { :wear { :pants \"velour flares\" :belt false } :tweet \"Okay, yes, I am Satoshi. #coverblown\" } Then, the two effects handlers registered for :wear and :tweet would be called to action those two effects. And, no, re-frame does not supply standard effect handlers for either, so you would need to have written them yourself, and then registered them. For example: ( re-frame.core/reg-fx ;; re-frame API :wear ;; the effects key which this handler can action ( fn [ val ] ;; val would be, eg, {:pants \"velour flares\" :belt false} ... )) ;; do what's necessary to action the side effect Domino 4 \u00b6 The action of updating app-db (in Domino 3) will trigger the v = f(s) part of the flow. The application state s has just changed (in Domino 3) and now boom, boom go Dominoes 4, 5, and 6, at the end of which we have a new view, v , being shown to the user. In this domino 4, a query (function) over this app state is automatically called. This query function \"extracts\" data from application state, and then computes \"a materialised view\" of the application state - producing data which is useful to the view functions in domino, 5. Now, in this particular case, the query function is pretty trivial. Because the items are stored in app state, there's not a lot to compute and, instead, it acts like a simple extractor or accessor, just plucking the list of items out of application state: ( defn query-fn [ db v ] ;; db is the current value in app-db, v the query vector ( :items db )) ;; not much of a materialised view On program startup, such a query-fn must be associated with a query-id , (so it can be used via subscribe in domino 5) using re-frame.core/reg-sub , like this: ( re-frame.core/reg-sub ;; part of the re-frame API :query-items ;; query id query-fn ) ;; function to perform the query Which says \"if, in domino 5, you see a (subscribe [:query-items]) , then call query-fn to compute it\". Domino 5 \u00b6 Because the query function for :query-items just re-computed a new value, any view (function) which uses a (subscribe [:query-items]) is called automatically (reactively) to re-compute new DOM (in response to a change in its source data). View functions compute a data structure, in hiccup format, describing the DOM nodes required. In this \"items\" case, the view functions will not be generating hiccup for the just-deleted item obviously but, other than this, the hiccup computed \"this time\" will be the same as \"last time\". ( defn items-view [] ( let [ items ( subscribe [ :query-items ])] ;; source items from app state [ :div ( map item-render @ items )])) ;; assume item-render already written Notice how items is \"sourced\" from \"app state\" via re-frame.core/subscribe . It is called with a vector argument, and the first element of that vector is a query-id which identifies the \"materialised view\" required by the view. Note: subscribe queries can be parameterised. So, in real-world apps you might have this: (subscribe [:items \"blue\"]) The vector identifies, first, the query, and then supplies further arguments. You could think of that as representing select * from Items where colour=\"blue\" . Except there's no SQL available and you would be the one to implement the more sophisticated query-fn capable of handling the \"where\" argument. More in later tutorials. Domino 6 \u00b6 The hiccup returned by the view function is made into real browser DOM by Reagent/React. No code from you required. Just happens. The DOM computed \"this time\" will be the same as \"last time\", except for the absence of DOM for the deleted item, so the mutation will be to remove those now-missing DOM nodes from the browser. 3-4-5-6 Summary \u00b6 The key point to understand about our 3-4-5-6 example is: a change to app state ... triggers query functions to rerun ... which triggers view functions to rerun which causes modified browser DOM Boom, boom, boom go the dominoes. It is a reactive data flow. Aaaaand we're done \u00b6 At this point, the re-frame app returns to a quiescent state, waiting for the next event. Two Sub-Cascades \u00b6 You might have noticed that there's actually two sub-cascades 1-2-3 and 4-5-6, and they have a similar structure. In each, it is the second to last domino which computes \"data descriptions\" of the changes required, and it is the last domino which does the dirty work and actions these descriptions. But you seldom need to worry yourself about the dirty work dominos. re-frame mostly takes care of them for you.

Now we're at 0 feet. We're writing code for a real app - live, in this document. Which App? \u00b6 The \"simple\" one. Within the re-frame repository's /examples folder is an app called /simple . It has 70 lines of code in a single namespace . We'll look at all 70 lines. Below, you should see the app running live. Try changing the display colour to magenta , #f00 or #02a6f2 . The live application should start here in 60 seconds ... Doesn't work? Maybe try disabling your adblocker for this site. When you change the live code on this page, the app will change. But that means we'll be loading a ClojureScript compiler into the browser, so be patient. This live coding is powered by Klipse . The Namespace \u00b6 Within our single namespace (of 70 lines), we'll need access to both reagent and re-frame . So, at the top we need this: (ns simple.core (:require [reagent.core :as reagent] [reagent.dom :as rdom] [re-frame.core :as rf])) Live Code Fragment Above, you'll see two vertically stacked boxes. The top one contains the live code. You can edit that code, if you want. The one below shows the result of evaluating that code. In this particular case, evaluating a ns gives nil which is not that interesting. The Data Schema \u00b6 Now, normally, I'd strongly recommended that you write a quality schema for your application state (the data stored in app-db ). But, here, to minimise cognitive load, we'll cut that corner. But, we can't cut it completely. You'll still need an informal description, and here it is ... app-db will contain a two-key map like this: { :time ( js/Date. ) ;; current time for display :time-color \"#f88\" } ;; the colour in which the time should be shown Event Dispatch \u00b6 Events are data. re-frame uses a vector format for events. For example: [ :time-color-change \"red\" ] The first element in the vector is a keyword which identifies the kind of event . Further elements are optional, and can provide additional data associated with the event. The additional value above, \"red\" , is presumably the colour. Here are some other example events: [ :admit-to-being-satoshi false ] [ :dressing/put-pants-on \"velour flares\" { :method :left-leg-first :belt false }] For non-trivial applications, the kind keyword will be namespaced, as it is in the 2nd example. dispatch To send an event, call dispatch with the event vector as the argument. ( dispatch [ :kind-of-event value1 value2 ]) For our simple app, we do this ... (defn dispatch-timer-event ;; <-- defining a function [] ;; <-- no args (let [now (js/Date.)] ;; <-- obtain the current time (rf/dispatch [:timer now]))) ;; <-- dispatch an event Notes: ignore the lower box. When defining a function, the return value is not interesting. current time is obtained with (js/Date.) which is like new Date() in javascript uses rf/dispatch - the re-frame API is aliased as rf in the namespace declaration above (defonce do-timer (js/setInterval dispatch-timer-event 1000)) Notes: setInterval is used to call dispatch-timer-event every second defonce is like def but it will ensure that only one timer is ever created. Even when doing hot reloading. A timer is an unusual source of events. Usually, it is an app's UI widgets which dispatch events (in response to user actions), or an HTTP POST's on-success handler, or a websocket which gets a new packet. So, \"simple\" is a little unusual. Moving on. After dispatch dispatch puts an event onto a queue for processing. So, an event is not processed synchronously, like a function call. The processing happens later - asynchronously. Very soon, but not now. The consumer of the queue is the re-frame router which looks after the event's processing. The router will: inspect the 1st element of an event vector look up the event handler (function) registered for this kind of event call this event handler (function) with the necessary arguments Our job, then, is to register an event handler function for each kind of event, including this :timer event. Event Handlers \u00b6 Collectively, event handlers provide the control logic in a re-frame application. In this application, three kinds of event are dispatched: :initialize - once when the program boots up :time-color-change - whenever the user changes the colour text field :timer - once a second Having 3 events means we'll be registering 3 event handlers. Registering Event Handlers Event handler functions: take two arguments coeffects and event return effects Conceptually, you can think of the argument coeffects as being \"the current state of the world\". And you can think of event handlers as computing how the world should be changed by the arriving event. They return (as data) how the world should be changed by the event - the side effects of the event. Event handlers can be registered in two ways: reg-event-fx reg-event-db One ends in -fx and the other in -db . reg-event-fx can take many coeffects and can return many effects reg-event-db allows you to write simpler handlers for the common case where you want them to take only one coeffect - the current app state - and return one effect - the updated app state. Many vs One. Because of its simplicity, we'll be using the latter one here: reg-event-db . reg-event-db We register event handlers using re-frame's API: ( rf/reg-event-db ;; <-- the re-frame API function to use :the-event-id ;; <-- the event id the-event-handler-fn ) ;; <-- the handler function The handler function you provide should expect two arguments: db - the current application state (the map value contained in app-db ) e - the event vector (given to dispatch ) So, your handler function will have a signature like this: (fn [db e] ...) . These event handlers must compute and return the new state of the application, which means they return a modified version of db . :timer (rf/reg-event-db :timer (fn [db [_ new-time]] ;; notice how we destructure the event vector (assoc db :time new-time))) ;; compute and return the new application state (rf/dispatch-sync [:timer (js/Date.)]) Notes: the event (2nd parameter) will be like [:timer a-js-time] sequence destructuring is used to extract the 2nd element of that event vector (ignores first with _ ) db is a map, containing two keys (see description above) this handler computes a new application state from db , and returns it it just assocs in the new-time value :initialize Once on startup, application state must be initialised. We want to put a sensible value into app-db , which starts out containing an empty map {} . A single (dispatch [:initialize]) will happen early in the app's life (more on this below), and we need to register an event handler for it. This event handler is slightly unusual because it ignores both of its arguments. There's nothing in the event vector which it needs. Nor is the existing value in db . It just wants to plonk a completely new value into app-db (rf/reg-event-db ;; sets up initial application state :initialize (fn [ _ _ ] ;; arguments not important, so use _ {:time (js/Date.) ;; returned value put into app-db :time-color \"orange\"})) ;; so the app state will be a map with two keys nil For comparison, here's how we could have written this if we did care about the existing value in db : ( rf/reg-event-db :initialize ( fn [ db _ ] ;; we use db this time, so name it ( -> db ;; db is initially just {} ( assoc :time ( js/Date. )) ( assoc :time-color \"orange\" ))) :time-color-change When the user enters a new colour value (into the input field) the view will (dispatch [:time-color-change new-colour]) (more on this below). (rf/reg-event-db :time-color-change (fn [db [_ new-color-value]] (assoc db :time-color new-color-value))) ;; compute and return the new application state nil Notes: it updates db to contain the new colour, provided as the 2nd element of the event Effect Handlers \u00b6 Domino 3 actions the effects returned by event handlers. In this \"simple\" application, our event handlers are implicitly returning only one effect: \"update application state\". This particular effect is accomplished by a re-frame-supplied effect handler. So, there's nothing for us to do for this domino. We are using a standard re-frame effect handler. And this is not unusual. You seldom write effect handlers. But it is covered in a later tutorial. Subscription Handlers \u00b6 Subscription handlers, or query functions, take application state as an argument and run a query over it, returning something called a \"materialised view\" of that application state. When the application state changes, subscription functions are re-run by re-frame, to compute new values (new materialised views). Ultimately, the data returned by these query functions flow through into the view functions (Domino 5). One subscription can source data from other subscriptions. So it is possible to create a tree structure of data flow. The Views (Domino 5) are the leaves of this tree. The tree's root is app-db and the intermediate nodes between the two are computations being performed by the query functions of Domino 4. Now, the two subscriptions below are trivial. They just extract part of the application state and return it. So, there's virtually no computation - the materialised view they produce is the same as that stored in app-db . A more interesting tree of subscriptions, and more explanation, can be found in the todomvc example. reg-sub reg-sub associates a query id with a function that computes that query, like this: ( rf/reg-sub :some-query-id ;; query id (used later in subscribe) a-query-fn ) ;; the function which will compute the query Later, a view function (domino 5) will subscribe to a query like this: (subscribe [:some-query-id]) , and a-query-fn will be used to perform the query over the application state. Each time application state changes, a-query-fn will be called again to compute a new materialised view (a new computation over app-db ) and that new value will be given to all view functions which are subscribed to :some-query-id . These view functions will then be called to compute the new DOM state (because the views depend on query results which have changed). Along this reactive chain of dependencies, re-frame will ensure the necessary calls are made, at the right time. Here's the code for defining our 2 subscription handlers: (rf/reg-sub :time (fn [db _] ;; db is current app state. 2nd unused param is query vector (:time db))) ;; return a query computation over the application state (rf/reg-sub :time-color (fn [db _] (:time-color db))) Both of these queries are trivial. They are known as \"accessor\", or level 2, subscriptions. More on that soon. View Functions \u00b6 view functions compute Hiccup. They are \"Data in, Hiccup out\" and they are Reagent components. A SPA will have lots of view functions, and collectively, they render the app's UI. Subscribing \u00b6 To render a hiccup representation of some part of the app state, view functions must query for that part of app-db , by using subscribe . subscribe is used like this: ( rf/subscribe [ query-id some optional query parameters ]) So subscribe takes one argument, assumed to be a vector. The first element in the vector identifies the query, and the other elements are optional query parameters. With a traditional database a query might be: select * from customers where name = \"blah\" In re-frame, that would look like: (subscribe [:customer-query \"blah\"]) , which would return a ratom holding the customer state (a value which might change over time!). Rookie Mistake Because subscriptions return a ratom (a Reagent atom), they must always be dereferenced to obtain the value (using deref or the reader macro @ ). Forgetting to do this is a recurring papercut for newbies. The View Functions \u00b6 This view function renders the clock: (defn clock [] (let [colour @(rf/subscribe [:time-color]) time (-> @(rf/subscribe [:time]) .toTimeString (clojure.string/split \" \") first)] [:div.example-clock {:style {:color colour}} time])) As you can see, it uses subscribe twice to obtain two pieces of data from app-db . If either value changes, reagent will automatically re-run this view function, computing new hiccup, which means new DOM. Using the power of klipse , we can render just the clock component: [clock] When an event handler changes a value in app-db , clock will rerender. Try it. Uncomment the following dispatch to change the colour. (comment (rf/dispatch [:time-color-change \"green\"])) And this view function renders the input field: (defn color-input [] (let [gettext (fn [e] (-> e .-target .-value)) emit (fn [e] (rf/dispatch [:time-color-change (gettext e)]))] [:div.color-input \"Display color: \" [:input {:type \"text\" :style {:border \"1px solid #CCC\" } :value @(rf/subscribe [:time-color]) ;; subscribe :on-change emit}]])) ;; <--- Notice how it does BOTH a subscribe to obtain the current value AND a dispatch to say when it has changed (look for emit ). It is very common for view functions to render event-dispatching functions into the DOM. The user's interaction with the UI is usually a large source of events. Notice also how we use @ in front of subscribe to obtain the value out of the subscription. It is almost as if the subscription is an atom holding a value (which can change over time). We can render the color-input as any other reagent component: [color-input] And then there's a parent view to arrange the others. It contains no subscriptions or dispatching of its own: (defn ui [] [:div [:h1 \"The time is now:\"] [clock] [color-input]]) view functions form a hierarchy, often with data flowing from parent to child via arguments (props in React). So, not every view needs a subscription if the values passed in from a parent component are sufficient. view functions never directly access app-db . Data is only ever sourced via subscriptions. Kick Starting The App \u00b6 Below, the function run is called to kick off the application once the HTML page has loaded. It has two tasks: Load the initial application state Load the GUI by \"mounting\" the root-level view - in our case, ui - onto an existing DOM element (with id app ). (defn mount-ui [] (rdom/render [ui] ;; mount the application's ui (js/document.getElementById \"dominoes-live-app\"))) (defn run [] (rf/dispatch-sync [:initialize]) ;; puts a value into application state (mount-ui)) When it comes to establishing initial application state, you'll notice the use of dispatch-sync , rather than dispatch . This is a simplifying cheat which ensures that a correct structure exists in app-db before any subscriptions or event handlers run. After run is called, the app passively waits for events . Nothing happens without an event . (run) The run function renders the app in the DOM element whose id is dominoes-live-app : this DOM element is located at the top of the page.

Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that does not make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, read it again until it does, because it is important. Steve Grand How Flow Happens In Reagent To implement a reactive flow, Reagent provides a ratom and a reaction . re-frame uses both of these building blocks, so let's now make sure we understand them. ratoms behave just like normal ClojureScript atoms. You can swap! and reset! them, watch them, etc. From a ClojureScript perspective, the purpose of an atom is to hold mutable data. From a re-frame perspective, we'll tweak that paradigm slightly and view a ratom as having a value that changes over time. Seems like a subtle distinction, I know, but because of it, re-frame sees a ratom as a Signal. A Signal is a value that changes over time. So it is a stream of values. Each time a ratom gets reset! that's a new value in the stream. The 2nd building block, reaction , acts a bit like a function. It's a macro which wraps some computation (a block of code) and returns a ratom holding the result of that computation . The magic thing about a reaction is that the computation it wraps will be automatically re-run whenever 'its inputs' change, producing a new output (return) value. Eh, how? Well, the computation is just a block of code, and if that code dereferences one or more ratoms , it will be automatically re-run (recomputing a new return value) whenever any of these dereferenced ratoms change. To put that yet another way, a reaction detects a computation's input Signals (aka input ratoms ) and it will watch them, and when, later, it detects a change in one of them, it will re-run that computation, and it will reset! the new result of that computation into the ratom originally returned. So, the ratom returned by a reaction is itself a Signal. Its value will change over time when the computation is re-run. So, via the interplay between ratoms and reactions , values 'flow' into computations and out again, and then into further computations, etc. \"Values\" flow (propagate) through the Signal graph. But this Signal graph must be without cycles, because cycles cause mayhem! re-frame achieves a unidirectional flow. Right, so that was a lot of words. Some code to clarify: ( ns example1 ( :require-macros [ reagent.ratom :refer [ reaction ]]) ;; reaction is a macro ( :require [ reagent.core :as reagent ])) ( def app-db ( reagent/atom { :a 1 })) ;; our root ratom (signal) ( def ratom2 ( reaction { :b ( :a @ app-db )})) ;; reaction wraps a computation, returns a signal ( def ratom3 ( reaction ( condp = ( :b @ ratom2 ) ;; reaction wraps another computation 0 \"World\" 1 \"Hello\" ))) ;; Notice that both computations above involve de-referencing a ratom: ;; - app-db in one case ;; - ratom2 in the other ;; Notice that both reactions above return a ratom. ;; Those returned ratoms hold the (time varying) value of the computations. ( println @ ratom2 ) ;; ==> {:b 1} ;; a computed result, involving @app-db ( println @ ratom3 ) ;; ==> \"Hello\" ;; a computed result, involving @ratom2 ( reset! app-db { :a 0 }) ;; this change to app-db, triggers re-computation ;; of ratom2 ;; which, in turn, causes a re-computation of ratom3 ( println @ ratom2 ) ;; ==> {:b 0} ;; ratom2 is result of {:b (:a @app-db)} ( println @ ratom3 ) ;; ==> \"World\" ;; ratom3 is automatically updated too. So, in FRP-ish terms, a reaction will produce a \"stream\" of values over time (it is a Signal), accessible via the ratom it returns. Components (view functions) \u00b6 When using Reagent, your primary job is to write one or more components . This is the view layer. Think about components as pure functions - data in, Hiccup out. Hiccup is ClojureScript data structures which represent DOM. Here's a trivial component: ( defn greet [] [ :div \"Hello ratoms and reactions\" ]) And if we call it: ( greet ) ;; ==> [:div \"Hello ratoms and reactions\"] You'll notice that our component is a regular Clojure function, nothing special. In this case, it takes no parameters and it returns a ClojureScript vector (formatted as Hiccup). Here is a slightly more interesting (parameterised) component (function): ( defn greet ;; greet has a parameter now [ name ] ;; 'name' is a ratom holding a string [ :div \"Hello \" @ name ]) ;; dereference 'name' to extract the contained value ;; create a ratom, containing a string ( def n ( reagent/atom \"re-frame\" )) ;; call our `component` function, passing in a ratom ( greet n ) ;; ==> [:div \"Hello \" \"re-frame\"] returns a vector So components are easy - at core they are a render function which turns data into Hiccup (which will later become DOM). Now, let's introduce reaction into this mix. On the one hand, I'm complicating things by doing this, because Reagent allows you to be ignorant of the mechanics I'm about to show you. (It invisibly wraps your components in a reaction allowing you to be blissfully ignorant of how the magic happens.) On the other hand, it is useful to understand exactly how the Reagent Signal graph is wired. ( defn greet ;; a component - data in, Hiccup out. [ name ] ;; name is a ratom [ :div \"Hello \" @ name ]) ;; dereference name here, to extract the value within ( def n ( reagent/atom \"re-frame\" )) ;; The computation '(greet n)' returns Hiccup which is stored into 'hiccup-ratom' ( def hiccup-ratom ( reaction ( greet n ))) ;; <-- use of reaction !!! ;; what is the result of the initial computation ? ( println @ hiccup-ratom ) ;; ==> [:div \"Hello \" \"re-frame\"] ;; returns hiccup (a vector of stuff) ;; now change 'n' ;; 'n' is an input Signal for the reaction above. ;; Warning: 'n' is not an input signal because it is a parameter. Rather, it is ;; because 'n' is dereferenced within the execution of the reaction's computation. ;; reaction notices what ratoms are dereferenced in its computation, and watches ;; them for changes. ( reset! n \"blah\" ) ;; n changes ;; The reaction above will notice the change to 'n' ... ;; ... and will re-run its computation ... ;; ... which will have a new \"return value\"... ;; ... which will be \"reset!\" into \"hiccup-ratom\" ( println @ hiccup-ratom ) ;; ==> [:div \"Hello \" \"blah\"] ;; yep, there's the new value So, as n changes value over time (via a reset! ), the output of the computation (greet n) changes, which in turn means that the value in hiccup-ratom changes. Both n and hiccup-ratom are FRP Signals. The Signal graph we created causes data to flow from n into hiccup-ratom . Derived Data, flowing. Truth Interlude I haven't been entirely straight with you: Reagent re-runs reactions (re-computations) via requestAnimationFrame. So a re-computation happens about 16ms after an input Signals change is detected, or after the current thread of processing finishes, whichever is the greater. So if you are in a bREPL and you run the lines of code above one after the other too quickly, you might not see the re-computation done immediately after n gets reset!, because the next animationFrame hasn't run (yet). But you could add a (reagent.core/flush) after the reset! to force re-computation to happen straight away. reaction doesn't actually return a ratom . But it returns something that has ratom-nature, so we'll happily continue believing it is a ratom and no harm will come to us. On with the rest of my lies and distortions... reg-sub-raw This low level part of the API provides a way to register a subscription handler - so the intent is similar to reg-sub . You use it like other registration functions: ( re-frame.core/reg-sub-raw ;; it is part of the API :query-id ;; later use (subscribe [:query-id]) some-fn ) ;; this function provides the reactive stream The interesting bit is how some-fn is written. Here's an example: ( defn some-fn [ app-db event ] ;; app-db is not a value, it is a reagent/atom ( reaction ( get-in @ app-db [ :some :path ]))) ;; returns a reaction Notice: app-db is a reagent/atom. It is not a value like reg-sub gets. it returns a reaction which does a computation. It does not return a value like reg-sub does. Within that reaction app-db is deref-ed (see use of @ ) As a result of point 3, each time app-db changes, the wrapped reaction will rerun. app-db is an input signal to that reaction . Unlike reg-sub , there is no 3-arity version of reg-sub-raw , so there's no way for you to provide an input signals function. Instead, even simpler, you can just use subscribe within the reaction itself. For example: ( defn some-fn [ app-db event ] ( reaction ( let [ a-path-element @ ( subscribe [ :get-path-part ])] ;; <-- subscribe used here ( get-in @ app-db [ :some a-path-element ])))) As you can see, this reaction has two input signals: app-db and (subscribe [:get-path-part]) . If either changes, the reaction will rerun. In some cases, the returned reaction might not even use app-db and, instead, it might only use subscribe to provide input signals. In that case, the registered subscription would belong to \"Layer 3\" of the signal graph (discussed in earlier tutorials). Remember to deref any use of app-db and subscribe . It is a rookie mistake to forget. I do it regularly. Instead of using reaction (a macro), you can use reagent/make-reaction (a utility function) which gives you the additional ability to attach an :on-dispose handler to the returned reaction, allowing you to do cleanup work when the subscription is no longer needed. See an example of using :on-dispose here Example reg-sub-raw The following use of reg-sub can be found in the todomvc example : ( reg-sub :visible-todos ;; signal function - returns a vector of two input signals ( fn [ query-v _ ] [( subscribe [ :todos ]) ( subscribe [ :showing ])]) ;; the computation function - 1st arg is a 2-vector of values ( fn [[ todos showing ] _ ] ( let [ filter-fn ( case showing :active ( complement :done ) :done :done :all identity )] ( filter filter-fn todos )))) we could rewrite this use of reg-sub using reg-sub-raw like this: ( reg-sub-raw :visible-todos ( fn [ app-db event ] ;; app-db not used, name shown for clarity ( reaction ;; wrap the computation in a reaction ( let [ todos @ ( subscribe [ :todos ]) ;; input signal #1 showing @ ( subscribe [ :showing ]) ;; input signal #2 filter-fn ( case showing :active ( complement :done ) :done :done :all identity )] ( filter filter-fn todos )))) A view could do (subscribe [:visible-todos]) and never know which of the two variations above was used.

First , imagine that all the events ever dispatched in a certain running app were stored in a collection (yes, event sourcing again). So, if when the app started, the user clicked on button X the first item in this collection would be the event generated by that button, and then, if next the user moved a slider, the associated event would be the next item in the collection, and so on and so on. We'd end up with a collection of event vectors.

So, now we can introduce the new mental model: at any point in time, the value in app-db is the result of performing a reduce over the entire collection of events dispatched in the app up until that time. The combining function for this reduce is the set of event handlers. It is almost like app-db is the temporary place where this imagined perpetual reduce stores its on-going reduction. Now, in the general case, this perspective breaks down a bit, because of reg-event-fx (has -fx on the end, not -db ) which allows: Event handlers to produce effects beyond just application state changes.

Human brains tend to focus first on the parts , and then, later, maybe on interconnections . But we know better, right? We know interconnections are often critical to a system. \"Focus on the lines between the boxes\" we lecture anyone kind enough to listen (in my case, glassy-eyed family members). In the case of re-frame, dominoes are the parts , so, tick, yes, we have looked at them first. Our brains are happy. But what about the interconnections ? If the parts are functions, as is the case with re-frame, what does it even mean to talk about interconnections between functions? To answer that question, I'll rephrase it as: how are the domino functions composed ? At the language level, Uncle Alonzo and Uncle John tell us how a function like count composes: ( str ( count ( filter odd? [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]))) We know when count is called, and with what argument, and how the value it computes becomes the arg for a further function. We know how data \"flows\" into and out of the functions. Sometimes, we'd rewrite this code as: ( ->> [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ( filter odd? ) count str ) With this arrangement, we talk of \"threading\" data through functions. It seems to help our comprehension to conceive function composition in terms of data flow . re-frame delivers architecture by supplying the interconnections - it threads the data - it composes the dominoes - it is the lines between the boxes. But it doesn't have a universal method for this \"composition\". The technique it uses varies from one domino neighbour-pair to the next. Initially, it uses a queue/router, then a pipeline of interceptors and, finally, a Signal Graph. Remember back in the Introduction? Our analogy for re-frame was the water cycle - water flowing around the loop, compelled by different kinds of forces at different times (gravity, convection, etc), going through phase changes.

They'll be staring, without seeing, at a spot in space, and in their heads, they'll be performing a runtime simulation of their code. But, as Dijkstra notes, this is hard. The Claim \u00b6 re-frame has a simple dynamic process It is the purpose of this page to explore and justify this claim. There's almost no more important point to make about re-frame than this one The primary design goal for re-frame is that it delivers an excellent developer experience. I believe that nothing contributes to this goal more than it having \"a simple dynamic model\". Almost nothing makes a programmer's job easier than a simple dynamic model. Almost nothing reduces bugs more than a simple dynamic model. On Dynamics \u00b6 When scientists or engineers study \"Dynamics\" they look at how a system develops or changes over time/space, and at the causes of those changes. Think of Hydrodynamics, Thermodynamics and Social Dynamics. A Web App is a \"sequential process\", and over time a sequential process will shift from one State to another, and consequently, often from one behaviour to another. The system \"Dynamics\" involve interactions between Computation and State , across time. State is effectively congealed time - history materialised - and it is accreted by rounds of Computation . Although it is Computation which creates the state, this Computation is itself controlled by the State because, for example, predicates on State determine which branches of Computation are executed. So, there's a feedback loop between these two. For a programmer, even just a few steps into any mental stimulation, there can be a lot to juggle, and we could be near the limits of our cognitive budget. Which leads to Dijkstra's lament. Certain kinds of interactions between time, State & Computation reduce dynamic complexity, making mental simulations easier, while others do the opposite and make it virtually impossible. And, any systems on the \"impossible\" end of that continuum, will breed nasty bugs and be scary to maintain. As programmers, we often talk about static concerns like DRY, line count, and \"cohesion vs coupling\". And while, yes, they are all useful, perhaps we should pay more attention to the qualities which make runtimes easier or harder to simulate in our heads. re-frame Time \u00b6 re-frame apps \"move forward\", through this computational/state space, one event after another. Time is discrete. Each event is entirely processed from beginning to end before the next event on the queue is processed. re-frame does not support the idea that an event can be \"suspended\" and then, later, restarted. It is only ever doing one thing at a time. And, when one of these events changes application state, it does so transactionally (instantly), in one fell swoop, not incrementally. So, at the highest level, re-frame delivers dynamics in discrete units, which can be understood and analysed independently. This serves to simplify the dynamics. But, how about one level down, within the processing of a single event? What about those dynamics? Processing An Event \u00b6 Do you remember those \"theory of computation\" lectures at Uni? The most limited kind of computation, and as a consequence, the easiest dynamic process to simulate in your head, was called a Finite State Machine. At the other end of the computational spectrum were Turing Machines. You can compute anything with a Turing Machine, which is awesome, right? Anything. Fantastic. But there might be a cost: your programming keyboard has now become a loaded gun. Is your foot safe? just because you can, doesn't mean you should re-frame's overarching process for handling a single event is one part \"Finite State Machine\" and one part dataflow. The event-handling process proceeds step by step through a linear set of logical states, which you know already as \"The Dominoes\". Only one state at a time is happening, and in each state there is specific behaviour/computation, and each of them is sufficiently isolated from the others that it can be understood and analysed independently. You can comfortably \"zoom in\" to understand each part. The re-frame docs don't formally talk about FSMs and, instead, present it as a \"data flow\" which causes transitions from one state to another. But the dominos are a simple FSM \"in nature\". Consequently, each event is processed using a simple kind of computation, making it easy to simulate in your head. Less Is More At this level, re-frame is less powerful by design . It delivers the minimum amount of power necessary to get the job done. Instead of providing computation with many degrees of freedom and occasional magic, it will give you simplicity and certainty. Less Is Scary Offering programmers less computational power makes them uncomfortable. We live in a world where requirements change on us all the time and often in unexpected and unwelcome ways. For our protection, so we can handle these unexpected requirements, we are attracted to more power, not less. But let's now go deeper again. But what about the dynamics within each Domino? Pure Functions \u00b6 Within a Domino, we are back to programming with the Turing complete power of ClojureScript. Thankfully, to harness and control that frightening power, you write pure functions and use immutable data. Pure functions stand outside of \"time\". To understand them, you don't need to know \"when\" they were run and the state of the system at that point. Instead, you need only know the value of their actual arguments. The tyranny of time is still present on the inside of the pure function, because there is an internal flow of execution. So, you might still need to simulate that in your head. But a pure function delivers a smaller dynamic process to understand - one that is more cognitively tractable. What is provided as arguments to a function is data, and what they return is data. Using immutable data for both acts to insulate pure functions from \"place\" - where data is put. Once functions are decoupled from both \"time\" and \"place\" they can be composed in a maximally mathematical way. I asked earlier what simplifying \"abstractions\" might exist to help us dampen the complexity of runtime dynamics, and these two are a very potent duo. Banana Issues Non-pure functions \"reach out\" and grab a banana (a value) from the global space beyond their arguments. Initially, it can seem innocent enough. But now, to understand the function's internal dynamics, you also need to understand the dynamics for everything that might change that banana over time. Unfortunately, as you pull the banana back towards you, you might discover a Gorilla is holding it. And that Gorilla is sitting in a jungle, so you get that too. Plus some Monsoonal weather. There's often a lot of new runtime dynamics coming your way, attached to that initial banana. Declarative \u00b6 Declarative programming means saying \"make X happen\", but not needing to specify how. So, it abstracts away the process, and it collapses the associated dynamics. re-frame has a lot of \"declarative\" happening. Reagent is a powerful declarative DOM capability. Events are declarative. Effects are declarative. The Signal Graph is declarative. And all this \"declarative\" is done with data-based DSLs, as is the Lisp way. Data DSLs Have you noticed that \"declarative\" is better when the DSL is defined in data? For example, Hiccup is an excellent DSL, and it is data. In the simple case, just data literals, but computation can be added to generate the data. SQL is string-based. As literals that's okay, but it completely sucks if we have to start computing the string. And regexs? Oof. A string-based DSL for a powerful, occasionally surprising computational paradigm. Forget \"now you have two problems\". Now you have an N x N matrix of interacting problems. State Management \u00b6 Nothing screams \"complicated dynamics\" more than needing to \"distribute state\". Well, other than appending \"... over unreliable networks\". This is, of course, why OO can be problematic. How on earth did we ever think that deliberately distributing state into hidden little mutable packets and then having to dynamically synchronise them was a good idea? And, Your Honour, I was as guilty as the rest. re-frame puts state in the one place and updates it once per event cycle, in one fell swoop. You never need to worry that the app is in some slightly inconsistent intermediate state. And you don't need to worry about the dynamics of communicating changes from one \"store\" of state to another. Also, in one fell swoop, you can check if all the state in your app (all of it!) conforms to a schema. And that includes any data which just arrived over the wire from the server. Incident report - \"Simple Dynamic Process\" \u00b6 While re-fame normally has a simple dynamic process, we acknowledge fat tail risk. On May 12th, at approximately 12:47am, re-frame became self-aware. It printed a single console log: \"Oh, really? I'll show you a simple dynamic process, f#$%ers\". Although a nuclear winter did follow, humans ultimately prevailed over the robot army, and the bug was found and fixed. So, all good. But if ever you notice a Signal Graph adopting a Cortex structure, we still recommend a precautionary reboot. Summary \u00b6 re-frame apps are simple to simulate in your head, and there are consequences - all of them good. This simplicity arises from a combination of factors. On this page, we have reviewed re-frame layer by layer, starting at a high level with how events are handled one after the other in a discrete way. Then, how a single event is handled step by step in a FSM-like way. Then, how pure functions and immutable data dramatically dampen dynamics. Then, through to how declarative data-based DSLs are used in multiple places.

There's almost no more important point to make about re-frame than this one The primary design goal for re-frame is that it delivers an excellent developer experience.

Almost nothing reduces bugs more than a simple dynamic model.","title":"The Claim"},{"location":"on-dynamics/#on-dynamics","text":"When scientists or engineers study \"Dynamics\" they look at how a system develops or changes over time/space, and at the causes of those changes. Think of Hydrodynamics, Thermodynamics and Social Dynamics. A Web App is a \"sequential process\", and over time a sequential process will shift from one State to another, and consequently, often from one behaviour to another. The system \"Dynamics\" involve interactions between Computation and State , across time. State is effectively congealed time - history materialised - and it is accreted by rounds of Computation . Although it is Computation which creates the state, this Computation is itself controlled by the State because, for example, predicates on State determine which branches of Computation are executed. So, there's a feedback loop between these two. For a programmer, even just a few steps into any mental stimulation, there can be a lot to juggle, and we could be near the limits of our cognitive budget. Which leads to Dijkstra's lament. Certain kinds of interactions between time, State & Computation reduce dynamic complexity, making mental simulations easier, while others do the opposite and make it virtually impossible. And, any systems on the \"impossible\" end of that continuum, will breed nasty bugs and be scary to maintain. As programmers, we often talk about static concerns like DRY, line count, and \"cohesion vs coupling\". And while, yes, they are all useful, perhaps we should pay more attention to the qualities which make runtimes easier or harder to simulate in our heads.","title":"On Dynamics"},{"location":"on-dynamics/#re-frame-time","text":"re-frame apps \"move forward\", through this computational/state space, one event after another. Time is discrete. Each event is entirely processed from beginning to end before the next event on the queue is processed. re-frame does not support the idea that an event can be \"suspended\" and then, later, restarted. It is only ever doing one thing at a time. And, when one of these events changes application state, it does so transactionally (instantly), in one fell swoop, not incrementally. So, at the highest level, re-frame delivers dynamics in discrete units, which can be understood and analysed independently. This serves to simplify the dynamics. But, how about one level down, within the processing of a single event? What about those dynamics?","title":"re-frame Time"},{"location":"on-dynamics/#processing-an-event","text":"Do you remember those \"theory of computation\" lectures at Uni? The most limited kind of computation, and as a consequence, the easiest dynamic process to simulate in your head, was called a Finite State Machine. At the other end of the computational spectrum were Turing Machines. You can compute anything with a Turing Machine, which is awesome, right? Anything. Fantastic. But there might be a cost: your programming keyboard has now become a loaded gun. Is your foot safe? just because you can, doesn't mean you should re-frame's overarching process for handling a single event is one part \"Finite State Machine\" and one part dataflow. The event-handling process proceeds step by step through a linear set of logical states, which you know already as \"The Dominoes\". Only one state at a time is happening, and in each state there is specific behaviour/computation, and each of them is sufficiently isolated from the others that it can be understood and analysed independently. You can comfortably \"zoom in\" to understand each part. The re-frame docs don't formally talk about FSMs and, instead, present it as a \"data flow\" which causes transitions from one state to another. But the dominos are a simple FSM \"in nature\". Consequently, each event is processed using a simple kind of computation, making it easy to simulate in your head. Less Is More At this level, re-frame is less powerful by design . It delivers the minimum amount of power necessary to get the job done. Instead of providing computation with many degrees of freedom and occasional magic, it will give you simplicity and certainty. Less Is Scary Offering programmers less computational power makes them uncomfortable. We live in a world where requirements change on us all the time and often in unexpected and unwelcome ways. For our protection, so we can handle these unexpected requirements, we are attracted to more power, not less. But let's now go deeper again. But what about the dynamics within each Domino?","title":"Processing An Event"},{"location":"on-dynamics/#pure-functions","text":"Within a Domino, we are back to programming with the Turing complete power of ClojureScript. Thankfully, to harness and control that frightening power, you write pure functions and use immutable data. Pure functions stand outside of \"time\". To understand them, you don't need to know \"when\" they were run and the state of the system at that point. Instead, you need only know the value of their actual arguments. The tyranny of time is still present on the inside of the pure function, because there is an internal flow of execution. So, you might still need to simulate that in your head. But a pure function delivers a smaller dynamic process to understand - one that is more cognitively tractable. What is provided as arguments to a function is data, and what they return is data. Using immutable data for both acts to insulate pure functions from \"place\" - where data is put. Once functions are decoupled from both \"time\" and \"place\" they can be composed in a maximally mathematical way. I asked earlier what simplifying \"abstractions\" might exist to help us dampen the complexity of runtime dynamics, and these two are a very potent duo. Banana Issues Non-pure functions \"reach out\" and grab a banana (a value) from the global space beyond their arguments. Initially, it can seem innocent enough. But now, to understand the function's internal dynamics, you also need to understand the dynamics for everything that might change that banana over time. Unfortunately, as you pull the banana back towards you, you might discover a Gorilla is holding it. And that Gorilla is sitting in a jungle, so you get that too. Plus some Monsoonal weather. There's often a lot of new runtime dynamics coming your way, attached to that initial banana.","title":"Pure Functions"},{"location":"on-dynamics/#declarative","text":"Declarative programming means saying \"make X happen\", but not needing to specify how. So, it abstracts away the process, and it collapses the associated dynamics. re-frame has a lot of \"declarative\" happening. Reagent is a powerful declarative DOM capability. Events are declarative. Effects are declarative. The Signal Graph is declarative. And all this \"declarative\" is done with data-based DSLs, as is the Lisp way. Data DSLs Have you noticed that \"declarative\" is better when the DSL is defined in data? For example, Hiccup is an excellent DSL, and it is data. In the simple case, just data literals, but computation can be added to generate the data. SQL is string-based. As literals that's okay, but it completely sucks if we have to start computing the string. And regexs? Oof. A string-based DSL for a powerful, occasionally surprising computational paradigm.

And, Your Honour, I was as guilty as the rest. re-frame puts state in the one place and updates it once per event cycle, in one fell swoop. You never need to worry that the app is in some slightly inconsistent intermediate state. And you don't need to worry about the dynamics of communicating changes from one \"store\" of state to another.

What does a Component do? \u00b6 Components have two responsibilities, and two needs. The responsibilities: rendering : provide a way for the user to observe a value. That value could be as simple as a string, or as complicated as an entire Pivot Table. optionally, show editing affordances to facilitate user modification of the value. A spinner supplies up/down buttons. A text input draws a box and has subtle colour changes on mouse-over to imply editability, and, of course, a \"click\" will initiate editing. Or the value could be a complete Pivot Table component which allows the user to drag \"fields\" to certain destinations to indicate how rollups should happen. communicate user intent : if the value is editted, communicate the user's intent to the surrounding app. In order to fulfil these two responsibilities, Components have two requirements : a way to get the value (input) a way to communicate events which represent user intent (output) One requirement is I and the other is O so, not surprisingly, we describe them as the Component's I/O requirements . Reagent Components \u00b6 The simplest Components are Widgets which represent a single value like an integer, string or selection. They are easily created from base HTML elements, like <input> or <select> , or there are libraries like re-com which has dropdowns, Text Input fields and radio buttons. You can create these Components using only Reagent (no re-frame) and, for that reason they are called Reagent Components . Here's an example: ( defn simple-text-input [ value callback-fn ] [ :input { :type \"text\" :value value ;; initial value :on-change # ( callback-fn ( -> % .-target .-value ))}]) ;; callback with value You'll notice that the I/O requirements of this Component, are satisfied by the two arguments: a value (input) a callback function (a means of communicating the user's intent to change the value). Because both needs are satisfied via arguments, this Component is quite reusable. It works for any string value. re-frame components \u00b6 What defines a re-frame component is that it uses dispatch and subscribe to satisfy its I/O requirements : subscribe is used to obtain values and dispatch is used to communicate events carrying user intent re-frame Components tend to be larger. They often represent an entire entity (not just a single, simple value) and they will probably involve a \"complex of widgets\" with a cohesive purpose. Here's an example: ( defn customer-names [ id ] ;; customer id ( let [ customer @ ( subscribe [ :customer id ])] ;; obtain the value [ :div \"Name:\" [ simple-text-input ( :first-name customer ) ;; obtain first-name from the entity # ( dispatch [ :customer-change id :first-name % ])] ;; first name changed ;; last name [ simple-text-input ( :last-name customer ) ;; obtain last-name from the entity # ( dispatch [ :customer-change id :last-name % ])]])) ;; last name changed Notes: This is a re-frame Component because it uses subscribe and dispatch for I/O It has two Reagent sub-components - the reusable simple-text-input component we created above It parameterises the I/O for the sub-components by passing in a value and a callback to each Many Instances \u00b6 If an app displays multiple instances of a re-frame Component , how do these instances subscribe to their specific value? One instance might represent entity A and will need to subscribe to data for that entity, and another instance might represent entity B , meaning its subscription will be different. How should they each obtain the value for their entity? Answer: instances of a reusable re-frame Component must be supplied with an argument which is the identity of the entity they should represent a component will use this identity within the query vector given to subscribe the subscription handler will know how to use this identity to obtain the entity's value likewise, any events dispatched will also include this identity (and the event handler will know how to use it) What Is Identity? \u00b6 An identity is something that can be used to differentiate one entity from another, within app-db . In a different technology stack, it might be called \"a pointer\" or \"a reference\" or \"a foreign key\". Within re-frame, an identity could be: a map key like \"1278\" or :warnings (for a map within app-db ) an integer index into a vector (again, somewhere within app-db ) a multi-part path from the root of app-db right down to some leaf element, like [:lavish :cloth 187] a sub-path of app-db Ultimately, all these example identities are sub-paths within app-db . An identity is always a piece of data. If it is a vector, it is likely a path or subpath. If it is a simple value, it is probably the key of a map or the index of a vector. Providing Identity \u00b6 When we create an instance of a re-frame Component, we supply it with the identity of an entity, via an argument which, for discussion purposes, we'll call id . The customer-names Component above takes an id argument. The query vector it provides to subscribe includes this id , so too does the event given to dispatch . As a result, this Component is reusable - our application can have many instances of it, and each can represent a different customer - just supply the customer id . Here's how we could use it multiple times on the one page to show many customers: ( defn customer-list [] [ :div ( for [ id @ ( subscribe [ :all-customer-ids ])] ^ { :key id } [ customer-names id ])]) Multiple Identities \u00b6 Some Components need more than one identity . For example, a Component might need: one identity for the list of alternative \"things\" a user can choose (think items in a dropdown) one identity for the current choice (value) held elsewhere within app-db This Component will need two args/props for these two identities . Derived Identities \u00b6 Imagine a Component (parent) which has a sub-component (child). The parent might need to provide its child with a sub-identity derived/computed from the id supplied to the parent. Perhaps the sub-identity is built by conj -ing a further value onto the original id . There are many possibilities. Or, in another situation, an id provided to a component might reference an entity which \"contains\", within its value, the identity of a further entity - a reference to a reference. So, the Component might have to subscribe to the primary entity and then, in a second step, subscribe to the derived entity. If we take these ideas far enough, we leave behind discussions about re-frame and start, instead, to discuss the pros and cons of the \"data model\" you have created in app-db . The Unit Of Reuse \u00b6 Have you noticed the need for close coordination between a re-frame Component and the subscriptions and dispatches which service it? A re-frame Component doesn't stand by itself - it isn't actually the unit of reuse. The unit of reuse is: the Component the subscription handlers which service its need to obtain values the events handler which handles the user intent it captures I noted at the beginning that a Component had two I/O needs. So the unit of reuse is the re-frame Component plus the mechanism for servicing those needs. That's what should be packaged up and put in your library. Implications \u00b6 Once you internalise that there are three parts to a reusable Component, you might realise that there is another level of abstraction possible. Up until now, I've said that a re-frame Component is defined by its use of subscribe and dispatch . But, maybe it doesn't have to be. Here is a rewrite of that earlier Component: ( defn customer-names [ id get-customer-fn cust_change-fn ] ( let [ customer ( get-customer-fn id )] ;; obtain the value [ :div \"Name:\" ;; first name [ simple-text-input ( :first-name customer ) ;; obtain first-name from the entity # ( cust_change-fn id :first-name % )] ;; first name has changed ;; last name [ simple-text-input ( :last-name customer ) ;; obtain last-name from the entity # ( cust_change-fn id :last-name % )]])) ;; last name has changed Notes: there's no sign of dispatch or subscribe anymore instead, the Component is parameterised by two extra functions arguments these functions handle the I/O it is almost as if we have gone full circle now, and we're back to building a Reagent Component. Let's rewrite the customer-list in terms of this new component: ( defn customer-list [] ( let [ get-customer ( fn [ id ] @ ( subscribe [ :customer id ])) put-customer ( fn [ id field val ] ( dispatch [ :cust-change id field val ]))]) [ :div ( for [ id @ ( subscribe [ :all-customer-ids ])] ^ { :key id } [ customer-names id get-customer put-customer ])]) Notes: we create the I/O functions which wrap the subscribes and dispatches these two functions are passed into the sub-component as arguments Does this approach mean the customer-names Component is now more reusable? Yes it does. The exact subscription query vector to use is now no longer embedded in the Component itself. The surrounding application supplies that. The Component has become even more independent of its context. It is even more reusable and flexible. Obviously there's always a cost to abstraction. You'll have to crunch the cost benefit analysis for your situation. BTW, in a more complicated case, you can imagine a Component being provided with more than just a couple of I/O functions. Instead, it could be supplied with a map which nominates many, many I/O functions which provide to it the necessary \"access\" it requires.","title":"Reusable Components"},{"location":"reusable-components/#what-does-a-component-do","text":"Components have two responsibilities, and two needs.

Within re-frame, an identity could be: a map key like \"1278\" or :warnings (for a map within app-db ) an integer index into a vector (again, somewhere within app-db ) a multi-part path from the root of app-db right down to some leaf element, like [:lavish :cloth 187] a sub-path of app-db Ultimately, all these example identities are sub-paths within app-db . An identity is always a piece of data. If it is a vector, it is likely a path or subpath. If it is a simple value, it is probably the key of a map or the index of a vector.","title":"What Is Identity?"},{"location":"reusable-components/#providing-identity","text":"When we create an instance of a re-frame Component, we supply it with the identity of an entity, via an argument which, for discussion purposes, we'll call id . The customer-names Component above takes an id argument. The query vector it provides to subscribe includes this id , so too does the event given to dispatch . As a result, this Component is reusable - our application can have many instances of it, and each can represent a different customer - just supply the customer id .

Or, in another situation, an id provided to a component might reference an entity which \"contains\", within its value, the identity of a further entity - a reference to a reference. So, the Component might have to subscribe to the primary entity and then, in a second step, subscribe to the derived entity. If we take these ideas far enough, we leave behind discussions about re-frame and start, instead, to discuss the pros and cons of the \"data model\" you have created in app-db .","title":"Derived Identities"},{"location":"reusable-components/#the-unit-of-reuse","text":"Have you noticed the need for close coordination between a re-frame Component and the subscriptions and dispatches which service it?

Up until now, I've said that a re-frame Component is defined by its use of subscribe and dispatch . But, maybe it doesn't have to be. Here is a rewrite of that earlier Component: ( defn customer-names [ id get-customer-fn cust_change-fn ] ( let [ customer ( get-customer-fn id )] ;; obtain the value [ :div \"Name:\" ;; first name [ simple-text-input ( :first-name customer ) ;; obtain first-name from the entity # ( cust_change-fn id :first-name % )] ;; first name has changed ;; last name [ simple-text-input ( :last-name customer ) ;; obtain last-name from the entity # ( cust_change-fn id :last-name % )]])) ;; last name has changed Notes: there's no sign of dispatch or subscribe anymore instead, the Component is parameterised by two extra functions arguments these functions handle the I/O it is almost as if we have gone full circle now, and we're back to building a Reagent Component. Let's rewrite the customer-list in terms of this new component: ( defn customer-list [] ( let [ get-customer ( fn [ id ] @ ( subscribe [ :customer id ])) put-customer ( fn [ id field val ] ( dispatch [ :cust-change id field val ]))]) [ :div ( for [ id @ ( subscribe [ :all-customer-ids ])] ^ { :key id } [ customer-names id get-customer put-customer ])]) Notes: we create the I/O functions which wrap the subscribes and dispatches these two functions are passed into the sub-component as arguments Does this approach mean the customer-names Component is now more reusable? Yes it does. The exact subscription query vector to use is now no longer embedded in the Component itself. The surrounding application supplies that. The Component has become even more independent of its context. It is even more reusable and flexible. Obviously there's always a cost to abstraction. You'll have to crunch the cost benefit analysis for your situation. BTW, in a more complicated case, you can imagine a Component being provided with more than just a couple of I/O functions. Instead, it could be supplied with a map which nominates many, many I/O functions which provide to it the necessary \"access\" it requires.","title":"Implications"},{"location":"review-todomvc/","text":"Congatulations!

At each moment, the DOM displayed is a \"materialised view\" of what is in app-db . Domino 3 modifies app-db and then boom, boom, boom go dominoes 4, 5 & 6, automatically producing this \"materialised view\", via a data flow. How Exactly? \u00b6 Data flows through The Signal Graph . app-db is the ground truth of a re-frame app, and it is at the root of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called the Signal Graph . At the other extent of this graph - at the leaves - are the ViewFunctions , which calculate hiccup. Typically, the Signal Graph is not deep, with only a few interior layers of nodes between root and leaves. These interior nodes are the subscription nodes that you create via regsub . Or, more accurately, you use regsub to register how such nodes should be created, if and when they are needed. Data flows through this graph, being transformed by the journey and, as a result, the data which arrives at the leaf ViewFunctions will be a materialised view of what was originally in app-db . The nodes of the graph are pure functions. When data flows along an arc and into a node, it becomes \"an argument\" to that node's pure function. That function will be \"called\" with the input arguments from input arcs, and it will produce a return value, which then flows along that node's output arcs to child nodes, where the process repeats. It is derived data all the way through the graph. Even the hiccup produced by leaf nodes is just more derived data. A re-frame app is 75% derived data. I just made that number up, but you get the idea: there's a bit of it. Indeed, the process doesn't stop with leaf ViewFunctions . Hiccup is turned into DOM, which is more derived data. And the browser turns DOM into pixels - yep, more data. And a monitor turns pixels into photons (data, don't fight me here, I'm on a roll), which your eye cells detect and turn into chemicals reactions (data) which cause nerve cell signals (totally data), which reaches the priors in your brain (data). Derived data all the way, baby! Your brain is domino 12. Too much? Okay, fine, back to the more limited picture. The Four Layers \u00b6 Conceptually, all nodes in the Signal Graph are a part of the same dataflow, but it will be instructive to label them as follows: layer 1 - ground truth - is the root node, app-db layer 2 - extractors - subscriptions which extract data directly from app-db , but do no further computation. layer 3 - materialised views - subscriptions which obtain data from other subscriptions (never app-db directly), and compute derived data from their inputs layer 4 - leaf nodes - the ViewFunctions which compute hiccup. The simplest version of the Signal Graph has no layer 3 nodes. It only has layer 2 subscriptions which extract data from app-db , and those values then flow unchanged into ViewFunctions . In more complex cases, a ViewFunction needs a materialised view of the data in app-db and means layer 3 subscription nodes. An extractor (layer 2) subscription will extract a fragment of app-db which will then flow into a layer 3 node which will compute the materialised view of that fragment and, only then, does data flow into the ViewFunction . As Infographic \u00b6 Graph Creation \u00b6 Although data flows through the Signal Graph from app-db towards the ViewFunctions , graph formation happens in the opposite direction. When a ViewFunction uses a subscription, like this (subscribe [:something :needed]) , the sub-graph of nodes needed to service that subscription is created. The necessary sub-graph will \"grow backwards\" from the ViewFunction all the way to app-db . So it is \"the data thirsty demands\" of currently rendered ViewFunctions which dictate what nodes exist in the Signal Graph . And, when a ViewFunction is no longer rendered, the sub-graph needed to service its needs will be destroyed, unless it is still needed to service the needs of another, current ViewFunction . Propagation Pruning \u00b6 The Signal Graph is reactive. When a node's inputs change, the node's subscription handler (function) re-runs automatically. The value it returns then becomes the node's new output value, and it will flow to downstream nodes in the graph, causing them to also re-run. But this only happens if the handler's output is different to the \"last time\" it ran. If a handler's return value \"this time\" is the same as \"last time\", data is not propagated to the sub-graph. No need. Nothing has changed. The computation for each node is performed by a pure function and a pure function will return the same value each time it is called with the same arguments. So, if we were to give a downstream node the same inputs as last time, it would produce the same outputs as last time, including the same hiccup at the leaves. Different How? \u00b6 Data values \"this time\" and \"last time\" are regarded as \"being the same\" if ClojureScript's = says they are. Why Layer 2? \u00b6 Why is a layer of \"extractors\" necessary? It is an efficiency thing. app-db will be changed by almost every event , often in a small, partial way. But any change whatsoever will cause Layer 2 subscription to be automatically re-run. All of them. Every time. This is because app-db is their input value, and subscriptions re-run when one of their inputs change. Layer 2 handlers extract a fragment from app-db and then immediately prune further propagation through their sub-graph graph if the fragment hasn't changed from \"last time\". As a consequence, the CPU intensive work in layer 3 and layer 4 is only performed when necessary. Layer 2 nodes act as the Signal Graph's circuit breakers. We want them to be as computationally simple as possible. reg-sub \u00b6 Subscription handlers are registered using reg-sub . These handlers are the functions which take input values, flowing into the node, and calculate a derived value to be the node's output. Layer 2 subscriptions are registered like this: ( re-frame.core/reg-sub ;; a part of the re-frame API :id ;; usage: (subscribe [:id]) ( fn [ db _ ] ;; `db` is the map out of `app-db` ( :something db ))) ;; trival extraction - no computation This registers a computation function - a pretty simple one which just does an extraction. Layer 3 subscriptions depend on other subscriptions for their inputs, and they are registered like this: ( reg-sub :id ;; signals function ( fn [ _ _ ] [( subscribe [ :a ]) ( subscribe [ :b 2 ])]) ;; <-- these are the inputs ;; computation function ( fn [[ a b ] _ ] ;; input values supplied in a vector ( calculate-it a b ))) You supply two functions: a signals function which returns the input signals for this kind of node. It can return either a single signal, or a vector of signals, or a map where the values are the signals. In the example above, it is returning a vector of signals. a computation function which takes the input values provided by the signals function , supplied as the first argument, and it produces a new derived value which will be the output of the node. Registration Doesn't Mean A Node Exists When you use reg-sub to register a handler, you are not immediately creating a node in the Signal Graph. At any one time, only those nodes required to service the needs of current ViewFunctions will exist. Registering a handler only says how to create a Signal Graph node when and if it is needed. Syntactic Sugar \u00b6 The Layer 3 subscription above can be rewritten using some syntactic sugar: ( reg-sub :id ;; input signals :<- [ :a ] ;; means (subscribe [:a] is an input) :<- [ :b 2 ] ;; means (subscribe [:b 2] is an input) ;; computation function ( fn [[ a b ] _ ] ( calculate-it a b )))","title":"Subscriptions"},{"location":"subscriptions/#on-derived-data","text":"The UI is just derived data.

May be incoherent and/or wrong. Don't read. Abstract This EP proposes changes to the way re-frame handlers are registered, to allow for the capture of richer handler metadata. These changes also lay the groundwork for tooling advances, and EPs to follow. Background re-frame's API currently includes 7 functions for registering handlers: - event: reg-event-db , reg-event-fx and reg-event-ctx - subscription: reg-sub and reg-sub-raw - effects: reg-fx - coeffects: reg-cofx Two others are on the drawing board: - reg-view - reg-interceptor So, there are potentially 9 kinds of handlers. Internally, re-frame manages registered handlers in a registrar , which is a two-level map, keyed at the first level by the kind of handler and, at the second level,\\by the (keyword) id of the handler. The leaf values are the handler functions themselves. Introduction \u00b6 This EP proposes that: 1. all current registration functions in the API be superseded by a new single macro reg 2. the leaf nodes of the registrar , which are currently the handler functions themselves, become instead a map of values related to the handler, including a doc string, the file/line where defined, specs, etc, and, of course, the handler itself. Motivations \u00b6 There's pressure from multiple directions to collect and retain more metadata about handlers: - tickets like #457 want docstrings for handlers - adding specs for events, so they can be checked at dev time - when re-frame becomes less of a framework and more of a library, handlers might need be \"grouped\" into \"packages\". So \"package\" information about handlers need to be supplied and retained. - Tooling support - we'd like re-frame-10x to actively help programmers when they are learning a new codebase. That's one of the four stated goals . Ideally, re-frame would be capable of providing tooling with \"a complete inventory\" of an app's handlers, along with useful metadata on each handles. When an event is processed, the audit trail of handlers involved should be rich with information. Macro \u00b6 As part of the retained handler metadata, we'd like to automatically capture source code coordinates, like namespace and line number. To make this happen, a macro will need to be introduced for registration, and that's a shift in approach because, until now, macros have been manfully resisted. Introducing docstrings into registrations also encourages a macro solution because docstrings should be removed from production builds. Method \u00b6 A new macro reg will become the method of registering handlers. The existing 7 registration functions will ultimately be deprecated. reg will take one argument, a map, which captures all aspects of the handler. Examples \u00b6 Previously, reg-event-db was used like this: ( rf/reg-event-db :event-id ( fn [ db event ] ( assoc db :some :thing ))) now, use reg would be used like this: ( rf/reg { :kind :event-db :id :event-id :fn ( fn [ db event ] ( assoc db :some :thing ))}) The map argument must contain the keys :kind , :id and :fn , with other valid keys being dependent on the kind of handler being registered. The value :kind can be one these 7 (mapping to 7 existing reg-* functions): - :event-db :event-fx :event-ctx - :sub :sub-raw - :fx - :cofx Optionally, for all kinds of handlers the the map can also have these additional keys: - :doc a doc string - :ns the namespace where the handler was registered - :line line number where the handler was registered - :file the name file where the handler was registered In a dev build, the reg macro will supply the final 3 (source code coordinates), if not explicitly supplied in the map. In a production build, the :doc string will be elided, so we do not appear in the final source code at all. The key :pkg is reserved for future use, and might eventually indicate the \"package\" to which this handler belongs. See EP 002. Other keys: XXX - :cept for interceptors (when registering events) - :ins for input signals (when registering subscriptions) - :ret for return spec (subscriptions and events) - :spec for event spec (when registering events) ??? Too much ?? XXX I'm not entirely happy about using short names like :cept . But, then again, there's the aesthetics of formatting the code and lining things up. XXX could have a :cofx key for event handlers to make them more explicit. Multiple Registrations The argument to reg can also be a vector of maps to allow for multiple handlers to be registered at once: ( rf/reg [{ :kind :event-db ... } { :kind :event-db ... } { :kind :event-fx ... } { :kind :sub ... ]) Or maybe move the registration keyword outside the map, to avoid repetition. ( rf/reg :event-db [{ ... } { ... } { ... } { ... ]) XXX maybe not needed. Provide the most minimal API? Then let towers of abstraction be built on top. Registrar Each entry stored in the registrar will become a map instead of just a handler. Map keys: - :kind - somehow redundant - :id - :doc - :line - :ns - :doc - :fn the handler XXX look into reg-sub Backwards Compatibility XXX Issues/Questions/Todos \u00b6 XXX implications for Cursive - it currently special-cases re-frame registration function -- give ColinF a heads up?? XXX Dear God, consider changes to documentation/tutorials XXX means giving up syntax sugar for reg-sub ? XXX any format for :doc for display in HTML?

Probably don't read. Abstract This EP proposes changes to allow multiple re-frame apps to coexist on the same (HTML) page. Introduction \u00b6 Currently, there can only be one instance of re-frame on a page. This design limitation simplifies the programmer's development experience in 98.3% of usecases (yes, I just pulled that number out of my keyboard). But there are some problematic usecases: 1. when two or more instances of the same app need to coexist on the one page: - think of devcards where instances should coexist - when unittesting, it might be useful to create re-frame \"instances\" serially, use them, and then throw them away. 2. when two or more instances of different re-frame apps need to coexist on the one page. Different, as in, one is TodoMVC and the other is a MemeCreator. The challenge is to facilitate these more complicated usecases while not, in the process, losing the current simplicity which is enjoyed most of the time. Global State As A Frame Currently, re-frame has some global state in the form of various atoms scattered about internal namespaces. The best known is app-db . It would be completely straightforward to scoop up this state and put it into some sort of defrecord whole - let's call it Frame - and then allow the programmer to create instances of Frame when they want to create a new instance of a re-frame app. Imagine there's a new API function called create-frame , which creates a new instance of this defrecord Frame and that you can call it as often as you want to create as many re-frame apps as needed. So, that was the easy bit. The Two Problems Now the design work has to start in earnest and there's two problems to solve: 1. how to associate/register handlers with a Frame 2. within a view function, how to subscribe or dispatch from/to the right Frame We'll start with problem #1. On Mutating registrars A re-frame app is defined collectively by its handlers. As an app boots, calls to registration functions like reg-event-db and reg-sub collectively \"build up\" an app, infusing it with behaviour and capability. This \"building up\" process currently involves progressive mutation of a global registrar (map) held internally within re-frame . Each registration adds a new entry to this registrar . If you are troubled by the thought of side effects on globals, there's an FAQ entry you may find interesting . Problem 1: Frames And Registrars The first design challenge to explore is: what's the new relationship between Frames and registrars . re-frame currently holds a global registrar of handlers, but in our new world, where there are different Frame instances on a page, should each of these Frames have its own registrar of handlers? And, if so, how and when should handlers be added to their registrars ? And, to support the developer experience, how should this work with figwheel reloads of namespace containing registrations? How should the registrar within a given Frame be updated? Let's explore via usecases ... In the usecase where there are multiple Frames on a page and they are all instances of the same app - for example, multiple TodoMVC apps - then all the Frames will have an identical set of handlers. So there need be only one central registrar (continue to use re-frame's global one?) and all Frames can look up handlers in this global registrar , and not hold one themselves. So continuing with a global registrar would work. But there are harder usecases to contend with. Ones where there are many Frames on a page, but each is for a different app . Imagine that one app on the page is TodoMVC and the other is a MemeCreator tool. Each Frame needs a different set of handlers. In which case, can we still put all handlers into a central registrar ? Maybe. But it would \"safer\" if each app's Frame only had access to the subset of handlers specific to that app. More ideas. Perhaps when registering a handler, the \"package\" to which it belongs can be nominated. Collections of related handlers would all belong to the same package. So all of the handlers for re-frame-undo would be registered as part of the package :re-frame-undo . And then, create-frame could, optionally, take a set of packages as an argument indicating which of them should be included/imported into the Frame being created. Its almost as if we are importing packages of handlers into a Frame . Keep in mind that there are libraries of handlers. re-frame-undo is a library which has event handlers, subscription handlers, etc. So one Frame on a page might need to include the package of re-frame-undo handlers, but another Frame on the same page might not. Alternatively, we could drop the notion of :package and simply work from the namespace of the registration id . XXX Perhaps if the handler ids were organised into app-specific collections, a central registrar could work. The collection mechanism could be as simple as insisting on ids with namespaces. Or if ==t could be that registration puts handlers into packages . And then, when we created a Frame , we'd need to indicate which of these \"packages\" (collections of handlers) should be \"imported\" into that Frame ? But keep in mind the need for updates to handlers being reloaded by figwheel (or the like). A Frame will need to \"get\" these updated handlers. And also k Problem 1 - Solutions Registration calls (to reg-event-db , etc) could be adjusted to take an additional Frame argument. So, Handlers get registered \"into\" a Frame . Solution sketch #2 : all handlers are registered as they are now using reg-event-db etc, and are stored (as now) in a central registrar (as now). But each handler belongs to a \"package\" (which defaults to :default ). When a frame is created, you can, optionally, supply the set of packages . When the Frame is created all handlers in the nominated packages are injected into the Frame . If not set is provided, then all handlers are injected. At this point, I favour sketch #2 from a backwards compatibility point of view. It is the least disruptive. Problem 2: Views, dispatch and subscription In an HTML page containing multiple devcard instances, all for exactly the same app, there will be one Frame for each devcard . In this scenario, how can a view know to which Frame it should subscribe ? And to which Frame it should dispatch ? Problem 2: Minimal Design Solution The \"minimal design\" approach is to say that Frames are passed as an argument into each view function, and then further passed down into child views, and so on, and so on. Then, when using dispatch or subscribe a view will use the arg given to it called, say, frame like this: (dispatch frame [:event-id arg]) . This approach is certainly simple. But it does get laborious and tedious pretty quickly. Every view needs to accept a frame and then pass it down to all children. Even intermediate Problem 2: Better Design Solution Solution sketch #2 : Hack Reagent so that a given node in the hierarchy can \"register\" a Frame, and then provide a a way so that any given view can \"query upwards\" through its the parent/owner hierarchy of views looking for the frame to which it should subscribe and dispatch. Solution sketch #3 : The Algebraic Effects approach is to piggyback on React's context facility. context only works for simple values, so this path would passing down the id of the frame, and then looking it up. Problem if we subscribe in a view, and that subscription needs to causes other subscriptions to be created, how to get at the associated frame at the point when we want to create the further subscriptions?","title":"002 ReframeInstances"},{"location":"EPs/002-ReframeInstances/#ep-002-multiple-re-frame-instances","text":"Status: Drafting.

Background React components form a tree, with values being passed down through the hierarchy in the form of props . All very functional. Except there are some problems: - it can be a PITA to pass every little bit of data through many, many layers. Manual and time consuming. - often we don't want to burden intermediate layers with knowledge about what leaf nodes needed. That kind of \"unnecessary knowing\" leads to various kinds of fragility. - if we are using someone else's layout components, we may have not have control over what they pass to children. Algebraic Effects are intended to help solve these kinds of problems in a functional way, but that's not our world. The solution available in React is called Context . It is a mechanism for allowing data to be \"shared\" globally within a given tree of React components (without it needing for it to be passed/threaded through all layers of that tree). React's context docs are here . Components re-com is a library which supplies reusable Reagent widgets. And widgets , like a datepicker, are the simplest kind of components. re-com components are reusability because they take an input stream of data and they achieves reusablity by passing in values and suppling callbacks.

Abstract Colloquial: I'd like re-frame to have a better story for programming in FSMs. I want to represent \"Higher Order Behaviour\" which currently gets \"smeared\" across multiple event handlers. Introduction Many high level aspects of SPAs are best modelled explicitly as an FSM. First, an app must gather X from the user, but if they press cancel, then return to showing Y, but otherwise move on to do activity Z. It is quite natural to model such overall decisions and the UIs involved as an FSM. Many low level aspects of SPAs are best modelled explicitly as FSM too. The simple act of GETing from a server involves various states, including waiting, and failed, and timed-out, and retrying and succeeded. BUT you need the power of a fully expressive state machine. You need orthogonal state, guards, hierarchical state, history, etc. Back in 1987, Harel identified the set of features required - anything less and your tool will not be expressive enough to do the job. Harel also insisted that statecharts was a visual formalism, so tooling is also important. Why? Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy. -- Alan Perlis State machines are appealing because: - they constrain you (vs the full Turing tar-pit). Just because you can wield immense power doesn't mean you should. - they force you to think through and structure a problem. This process helps to flush out the corner cases. - they make explicit certain important assumptions which are otherwise hidden in a thicket of conditionals. Also, Why Developers Never Use State Machines https://www.skorks.com/2011/09/why-developers-never-use-state-machines/ \"The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will.\" - Reg Braithwaite How? Technical elements: - a way to register: - a state machine specification against a machine-id - the specification will be a data structure, listing states, transitions, etc - a way to create an instance of a registered state machine - args: machine-id, id for this particular instance - data for machine instance will be stored in app-db (at :machines or a configurable place?) - a way to trigger - the id of the state machine targeted - the trigger - the trigger args - trigger causes: - state transition - an action fn to be called which produces :effects - UI changes. See EP on reg-view which will make it much easier to describe UI in machine data structure - a way to destroy an instance Misc Notes Events model user intent, not implementation details. So, we DO NOT want events that talk about FSM or triggers etc because that's an implementation detail. Instead, we want But event handlers should know about XXX Triggers Types of triggers: 1. External (from the user, websocket) 2. Data - something about app-db has changed Implementation What if we didn't even use FSM and used Behaviour Trees instead? Behaviour trees are more composable.

Instead, the more portable (but more complicated) version of this approach is to use React refs and a form-3 component: ( defn my-input [] ( let [ ref ( atom nil )] ( r/create-class { :component-did-mount ( fn [ _ ] ( .focus @ ref )) :reagent-render ( fn [ _ ] [ :input { :ref # ( reset! ref % )}])}))) But, it turns out this can be rewritten more tersely as: [ :input { :ref # ( when % ( .focus % )}] All these approaches only cause focus once, when the widget is first rendered, but you may need to have more control than that. Reagent after-render \u00b6 If you want to switch focus between elements after they have first rendered, you can create an effect handler which makes use of Reagent's after-render API to register a function which will imperatively set focus: ( re-frame.core/reg-fx :focus-to-element ( fn [ element-id ] ( reagent/after-render # ( some-> js/document ( .getElementById element-id ) .focus ))) As written, this code will fail silently if element-id is not found.

You can then use this effect within your event handler: ( re-frame.core/reg-event-fx :something ( fn [ cofx event ] { :db .... :focus-to-element some-element-id })) This does assume you can compute the some-element-id of the HTML element on which you want focus.

For Javascript The Developer \u00b6 Are you from the Javascript/React world? If so, this first section is for you. In re-frame, Components are functions. They compute a materialized view of values which are reactively delivered, and they don't have state. On the other hand, React has a more OO sense of Components. They are classes with state and behaviour. And even React's more modern, so-called function components come with Hooks which are ordered, and often imperative and effectful. So, with respect to Components, re-frame and React are technically different. But it is on a philosophical point that they differ the most: In re-frame, Components are not causal , they are reactive. Whereas React Components are often deeply causal, via Collocated queries, ComponentDidMount, Hooks and Suspense, etc. In React, Components initiate things - like HTTP requests. In re-frame, it is events which are causal (never components). Why this difference? Humans have a cognitive bias: \"what is focal is presumed causal\". Political leaders know this. They like presenting good news themselves because they like to be \"seen\" as causal of good stuff, but they'll get a press secretary to deliver bad news. Movie directors know how to use this when framing their protagonists within the story. Unfortunately, the React team have lost themselves in this bias. They keep trying to make the most focal part of the system (components) also be the causal part. Please stop doing that! It is a mistake. Events are what's causal - they embody the user's intent. Just to be clear, I love React. What an utterly brilliant idea and great execution. I'm deeply grateful because, wow!, did it change things. It is just that I preferred React when it was only trying to be the V part of MVC. Everything since has been downhill. Perhaps read the further explanation in PurelyFunctional.tv's writeup under the heading \"Reacters load data on mount\". Do This Instead \u00b6 With re-frame, imperative, effectful stuff only ever happens during the handling of an event. When the user clicks on a tab to change what is shown to them in the UI, an event is dispatched, and it is the associated event handler which will compute the effects of the user's request. That might include: change application state so the panel is shown further change application state so that a \"twirly busy\" thing is shown issue a database query or open a websocket Also, remember that events should model \"user intent\", like \"review overdue items\". Be sure to never model events like \"load overdue items from database\" because that's just a low level operation performed in the service of fulfilling the user's intent.

How is it functional to side effect globally? Background \u00b6 A re-frame app is defined collectively by its handlers. As an app boots, calls to registration functions like reg-event-db and reg-sub collectively \"build up\" an app, infusing it with behaviour and capability. Currently, this \"building up\" process involves the progressive mutation of a global registrar (map) held internally within re-frame . Each registration adds a new entry to this registrar . How should we analyse this from a functional point of view? Answer \u00b6 There are three ways to view this: Egads! Say it isn't true. Mutation of a global? Summon the functional lynch mob! In theory, top-level side effects will introduce some pain points, but re-frame's design represents a conscious decision to trade off functional purity for simplicity of everyday developer experience. So, yes, re-frame represents a point in the possible design space, with associated pros and cons. But the cons tend to be theoretical and the pros are real. Actually, there's no purity problem! As a Clojure program starts, each defn (becomes a def which) happily interns a symbol and function in a map-ish structure representing a namespace . The lynch mob stays home for that. The pitchforks remain in their rack. re-frame handler registration is the same pattern - an id and handler function are interned within a map-ish structure (a registrar ), once, on program load. So, if you feel uncomfortable with what re-frame does, you should also feel uncomfortable about using defn . Also, it would be useful to understand how you are creating a virtual machine when you program re-frame While Point 3 is an interesting perspective to consider, the real discussion should probably be around points 1 and 2: is it a good idea for re-frame to tradeoff purity for simplicity? You can't really judge this properly until you have used it and experienced the simplicity, and/or found pain points (devcards!). Many people experience few problems and live happily ever after.

If the user is typing very quickly, then the following race condition can occur: The user types a new character taking the field from state A to state B ( B has one new, extra character in it, compared to state A ) The change event for state B is dispatched by on-change . And that event is queued for processing. But before that event can be processed, the browser schedules an annimation frame. In that annimation frame the component is rerendered But during that reender the subscribe will deliver state A That means the text in the box will revert from state B to state A (the character just typed won't be in the input) Now if nothing happened till the next annimation frame the situation would resolve itself. Because state B would be rendered next time because the event which included the new character would have been processed well before then. BUT if the user immediaetly types another character, the state dispatched will be State A + new character . The prevous character typed, which caused A -> B, is now lost. Bottom line: with very fast typing, characters can get dropped just before annimation-frames. There are three solutions: don't use on-change , and instead use on-blur which is only called when the user has done all their fast typing and they leave the field. if you have to use on-change then switch to use dispatch-sync in on-change , instead of dispatch .

Angular's terrifying faceplant is a sobering reminder to us all. With this release, re-frame's already impressive buzzword muscles bulge further with new walnuts like \"effects\", \"coeffects\", \"interceptors\" and \"de-duplicated signal graph\". I know, right? Some may even find these new features useful. Joking aside, this is a substantial release which will change how you use re-frame. Headline re-frame subscriptions are now de-duplicated. As a result, many Signal graphs will be more efficient. The new behaviour better matches programmer intuitions about what \"should\" happen. Each subscription causes a handler to execute, producing a reactive stream of updates. Two calls to (subscribe [:some :query]) results in two copies of the same subscription handler running, each delivering a stream of updates. Now, if these two subscriptions were running at the same time, this would be inefficient. Both handlers would be doing the same computations and delivering the same stream of updates. Unnecessary, duplicate work. Starting with this version, this sort of duplication has been eliminated. Two, or more, concurrent subscriptions for the same query will now source reactive updates from the one executing handler. So, how do we know if two subscriptions are \"the same\"? Answer: two subscriptions are the same if their query vectors test = to each other. So, these two subscriptions are not \"the same\": [:some-event 42] [:some-event \"blah\"] . Even though they involve the same event id, :some-event , the query vectors do not test = . added a new subscription handler registration function called re-frame.core/reg-sub . It is an alternative to re-frame.core/register-sub (now renamed to re-frame.core/reg-sub-raw ). reg-sub is significantly easier to use and understand, while often also being more performant. The design has really fallen out nicely and we're delighted with it. With reg-sub , you no longer need to use reaction explicitly. Subscription handlers are now pure which makes them easier to understand, trace and test etc. Plus, as you'll see in the docs, there is some gratuitous syntactic sugar. Who doesn't like sugar? At this point, the todomvc example represents the best tutorial on the subject: https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/examples/todomvc/src/todomvc/subs.cljs re-frame now supports the notion of Event Handlers accepting coeffects and returning effects. There's now three kinds of event handlers: -db , -fx and -ctx . For a tutorial see: https://github.com/day8/re-frame/tree/master/docs For Effect Handler examples see: https://github.com/day8/re-frame-http-fx https://github.com/day8/re-frame-forward-events-fx https://github.com/day8/re-frame-async-flow-fx You can now run and debug re-frame tests on the JVM. Just to be clear: this does not mean you can run re-frame apps on the JVM (there's no React or Reagent available). But you can debug your event handler tests using full JVM tooling goodness. @samroberton and @escherize have provided the thought leadership and drive here. They converted re-frame to .cljc , supplying pluggable interop for both the js and jvm platforms. Further, they have worked with @danielcompton to create a library of testing utilities which will hopefully evolve into a nice step forward on both platforms: https://github.com/day8/re-frame-test Work is ongoing in this area. the undo/redo features buried in re-frame has been factored out into a standalone library . undo and redo have been a part of re-frame from the beginning, but they have never officially been made a part of the API, and have not been documented. So it nice to see it available, and fully documented. This new library includes various enhancements over that which previously existed, and it works in with effectful handlers described above. Middleware is dead, long live Interceptors. Up until now, re-frame has allowed you to decorate event handlers with middleware which looked after the cross cutting concerns of tracing, undo/redo, validation, etc. This has proved a neat and successful part of the framework. We thought we were happy. But recently @steveb8n gave a cljsyd talk on Pedestal's Interceptor pattern which suddenly transformed them from arcane to delightfully simple in 20 mins. Interceptors are really \"middleware via data\" rather than \"middleware via higher order functions\". So it is another way of doing the same thing, but thanks to @steveb8n Interceptors appear a more flexible base, and simpler. Interceptors also dovetail really nicely with the effects and coeffects story which has emerged in re-frame through this 0.8.0 release. Docs: https://github.com/day8/re-frame/tree/master/docs we now have a logo designed by Sketch Maester @martinklepsch. Thank you Martin! But remember, no good deed ever goes unpunished - we'll be pestering you every time from now on :-) Breaking requires Reagent >= v0.6.0 re-frame.core/register-handler has been renamed re-frame.core/reg-event-db . There's now three kinds of event-handlers, -db , -fx and -ctx . Event handlers of the 2nd and 3rd kinds should be registered via the new registration functions re-frame.core/reg-event-fx and re-frame.core/reg-event-ctx re-frame.core/register-sub has been renamed re-frame.core/reg-sub-raw . This is to indicate that this kind of registration is now considered the low level, close to the metal way to create subscriptions handlers. This release introduced reg-sub which becomes the preferred way to register subscription handlers. middlewares have been replaced by Interceptors. In day to day use, there's a good chance you won't notice the change UNLESS: You have written your own middleware. If so, you'll have to rewrite it. See how the builtin interceptors are done . You explicitly use comp to compose middleware like this: clj (reg-event-db :some-id (comp debug tim-v) ;; <-- change to [debug trim-v] (fn [db event] ...)) if you have previously used the undo/redo capabilities buried in re-frame, be aware they have extracted into a sibling library: https://github.com/day8/re-frame-undo. By default, re-frame uses js/console functions like error and warn when logging, but you can supply alternative functions using re-frame.core/set-loggers! . With this release, any alternatives you supply will be called with different parameters. Previously loggers were called with a single str parameter but now they are expected to act like console.log itself and take variadic, non string params. Sorry to break things, but we are trying to maximise use of cljs-devtools and information is lost when strings are output, instead of actual data. Of course, you need only worry about this if you are using re-frame.core/set-loggers! to hook in your own loggers. If you are, then, to transition, you'll need to tweak like this: ``` ;; your old log function might have looked like this. Single string parameter. (defn my-logger [s] (do-something-with s)) ;; your new version will have variadic params, and turn them into a string (defn my-logger [& args] (do-something-with (apply str args)) ``` Improvements Bug fix: post-event-callbacks were not called when dispatch-sync was called. added new API re-frame.core/clear-post-event-callback which de-registers a callback previously added by re-frame.core/add-post-event-callback when an event-handler makes no change to app-db , the debug middleware now logs a single line saying so, rather than a \"group\". Makes it slightly easier to grok the absence of change. Standardised test namespaces: renamed to use -test suffix and moved to eliminate redundant /test folder Added cljs.test based tests via browser/html. These mimic original karma tests.
