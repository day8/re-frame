(def do-fx
  "An interceptor whose `:after` actions the contents of `:effects`. As a result,
  this interceptor is Domino 3.

  This interceptor is silently added (by reg-event-db etc) to the front of
  interceptor chains for all events.

  For each key in `:effects` (a map), it calls the registered `effects handler`
  (see `reg-fx` for registration of effect handlers).

  So, if `:effects` was:
      {:dispatch  [:hello 42]
       :db        {...}
       :undo      \"set flag\"}

  it will call the registered effect handlers for each of the map's keys:
  `:dispatch`, `:undo` and `:db`. When calling each handler, provides the map
  value for that key - so in the example above the effect handler for :dispatch
  will be given one arg `[:hello 42]`.

  You cannot rely on the ordering in which effects are executed, other than that
  `:db` is guaranteed to be executed first."
