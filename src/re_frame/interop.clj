(ns re-frame.interop
  (:import [java.util.concurrent Executor Executors]))


;; The purpose of this file is to provide JVM-runnable implementations of the
;; CLJS equivalents in interop.cljs.
;;
;; These implementations are to enable you to bring up a re-frame app on the JVM
;; in order to run tests, or to develop at a JVM REPL instead of a CLJS one.
;;
;; Please note, though, that the purpose here *isn't* to fully replicate all of
;; re-frame's behaviour in a real CLJS environment.  We don't have Reagent or
;; React on the JVM, and we don't try to mimic the stateful lifecycles that they
;; embody.
;;
;; In particular, if you're performing side effects in any code that's triggered
;; by a change to a Ratom's value, and not via a call to `dispatch`, then you're
;; going to have a hard time getting any accurate tests with this code.
;; However, if your subscriptions and Reagent render functions are pure, and
;; your side-effects are all managed by effect handlers, then hopefully this will
;; allow you to write some useful tests that can run on the JVM.
