;; -- Router Loop ------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; A call to "re-frame.core/dispatch" places an event on a queue for processing.
;; A short time later, the handler registered to handle this event will be run.
;; What follows is the implementation of this process.
;;
;; The task is to process queued events in a perpetual loop, one after
;; the other, FIFO, calling the registered event-handler for each, being idle when
;; there are no events, and firing up when one arrives.
;;
;; But browsers only have a single thread of control and we must be
;; careful to not hog the CPU. When processing events one after another, we
;; must regularly hand back control to the browser, so it can redraw, process
;; websockets, etc. But not too regularly! If we are in a de-focused browser
;; tab, our app will be CPU throttled. Each time we get back control, we have
;; to process all queued events, or else something like a bursty websocket
;; (producing events) might overwhelm the queue. So there's a balance.
;;
;; The processing/handling of an event happens "asynchronously" sometime after
;; that event was enqueued via "dispatch". The original implementation of this router loop
;; used `core.async`. As a result, it was fairly simple, and it mostly worked,
;; but it did not give enough control. So now we hand-roll our own,
;; finite-state-machine and all.
;;
;; In what follows, the strategy is this:
;;   - maintain a FIFO queue of `dispatched` events.
;;   - when a new event arrives, "schedule" processing of this queue using
;;     goog.async.nextTick, which means it will happen "very soon".
;;   - when processing events, one after the other, do ALL the currently
;;     queued events. Don't stop. Don't yield to the browser. Hog that CPU.
;;   - but if any new events are dispatched during this cycle of processing,
;;     don't do them immediately. Leave them queued. Yield first to the browser,
;;     and do these new events in the next processing cycle. That way we drain
;;     the queue up to a point, but we never hog the CPU forever. In
;;     particular, we handle the case where handling one event will beget
;;     another event. The freshly begotten event will be handled next cycle,
;;     with yielding in-between.
;;   - In some cases, an event should not be handled until after the GUI has been
;;     updated, i.e., after the next Reagent animation frame. In such a case,
;;     the event should be dispatched with :flush-dom metadata like this:
;;       (dispatch ^:flush-dom [:event-id other params])
;;     Such an event will temporarily block all further processing because
;;     events are processed sequentially: we handle one event completely
;;     before we handle the ones behind it.
;;
;; Implementation notes:
;;   - queue processing can be in a number of states: scheduled, running, paused
;;     etc. So it is modeled as a Finite State Machine.
;;     See "-fsm-trigger" (below) for the states and transitions.
;;   - the scheduling is done via "goog.async.nextTick" which is pretty quick
;;   - when the event has :flush-dom metadata we schedule via
;;       "reagent.core.after-render"
;;     which will run event processing after the next Reagent animation frame.
;;

;; Events can have metadata which says to pause event processing.
;; event metadata -> "run later" functions
(def later-fns
  {:flush-dom (fn [f] (after-render #(next-tick f)))   ;; one tick after the end of the next animation frame
   :yield     next-tick})               ;; almost immediately
