;; -- Spec --------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is a clojure.spec specification for the value in app-db. It is like a
;; Schema. See: http://clojure.org/guides/spec
;;
;; The value in app-db should always match this spec. Only event handlers
;; can change the value in app-db so, after each event handler
;; has run, we re-check app-db for correctness (compliance with the Schema).
;;
;; How is this done? Look in events.cljs and you'll notice that all handers
;; have an "after" interceptor which does the spec re-check.
;;
;; None of this is strictly necessary. It could be omitted. But we find it
;; good practice.

;; -- Default app-db Value  ---------------------------------------------------
;;

;; Look in `core.cljs` for  "(dispatch-sync [:initialise-db])"

;; -- Local Storage  ----------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Part of the todomvc challenge is to store todos in LocalStorage, and
;; on app startup, reload the todos from when the program was last run.
;; But the challenge stipulates to NOT  load the setting for the "showing"
;; filter. Just the todos.
