Optionally, provide\n  an `interceptors` chain.\n  `id` is typically a namespaced keyword  (but can be anything)\n  `handler` is a function: (coeffects-map event-vector) -> effects-map\n  `interceptors` is a collection of interceptors. Will be flattened and nils removed.\n  `handler` is wrapped in its own interceptor and added to the end of the interceptor\n   chain, so that, in the end, only a chain is registered.\n   Special effects and coeffects interceptors are added to the front of the\n   interceptor chain.  These interceptors inject the value of app-db into coeffects,\n   and, later, action effects."],"~$register-handler",["^ ","^1:",null,"^14",["^ ","^[","^8","^10",229,"^11",7,"^12",229,"^13",23,"^1;",["^1<",["^1=",["^1<",[["~$&","^1O"]]]]],"^1P",["^ ","^1E",true,"^1Q",0,"^1H",0,"^1B",[["^1<",["^1O"]]],"^1;",["^1<",[["~$&","^1O"]]],"^1D",["^1<",[null]]]],"^7","~$re-frame.core/register-handler","^[","re_frame/core.cljc","^13",23,"^1P",["^ ","^1E",true,"^1Q",0,"^1H",0,"^1B",[["^1<",["^1O"]]],"^1;",["^1<",[["~$&","^1O"]]],"^1D",["^1<",[null]]],"^1B",[["^1<",["^1O"]]],"^1C",null,"^1Q",0,"^1D",["^1<",[null]],"^11",1,"^1E",true,"^1S",[["^ ","^1Q",0,"^1E",true,"^1T","^1G"]],"^10",229,"^1F","^1G","^12",229,"^1H",0,"^1I",true,"^1;",["^1<",[["~$&","^1O"]]]],"~$clear-subscription-cache!",["^ ","^7","~$re-frame.core/clear-subscription-cache!","^[","re_frame/core.cljc","^10",49,"^11",1,"^12",49,"^13",31,"^14",["^ ","^[","^8","^10",49,"^11",6,"^12",49,"^13",31]]],"~:cljs.spec/registry-ref",[],"~:require-macros",["^ "],"~:cljs.analyzer/constants",["^ ","~:seen",["^6",["~:warn"]],"~:order",["^3@"]],"^1@",null]
